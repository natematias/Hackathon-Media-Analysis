But the FCC wants to change that. On Monday, over 100 developers converged at FCC headquarters for a 9-hour collaborative <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack_Day\">hack day</a>, with the goal of making software that employs the <a href=\"http://reboot.fcc.gov/developer\">APIs and datasets the FCC makes available to the public</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The main meeting room, which usually has chairs lined up facing the dais\r\n for hearings, was set up with small tables equipped with power strips, \r\nStarburst and Snickers bars for Open Developer Day. There was a live&nbsp;<a href=\"http://reboot.fcc.gov/video-archives\">video stream</a>, and attendees and viewers were encouraged to tag their tweet&nbsp;<a href=\"http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23fccdevday\">#fccdevday</a>. From the podium, \r\nChief Data Officer Greg Elin said, \"I've never looked out into this room\r\n and seen it filled with developers. This is a first for the FCC.\" </p><p>Three new apps were created out of the event. </p><p>The first webapp uses the FCC's <a href=\"http://reboot.fcc.gov/developer/consumer-broadband-test-api\">Broadband Speed Test API</a> and HTML5's browser-based location feature.

but to be honest making a complaint is just too much hard work.            The latest and most ambitious venture from  MySociety , the civic hacking organisation behind sites like  TheyWorkForYou , aims to be a one-stop shop for people trying to get their transport improved. \u00a0           A simple and attractive interface, with the tremendous catchphrase \"Euston, we have a problem\", invites users to report a problem, and have their issues forwarded to the right operator or local authority. Their responses will then be reported on the site, and if the issue is finally resolved, that information will be made public.           The site has been undergoing live testing for some weeks, and there are already some examples of how it's working.          One user complained that the Greenland Pier, where passengers board commuter boats down the Thames, was in poor repair. There was a swift reply, informing him that the local council was planning to renovations, and the issue is now listed as \"fixed\".           It is a similar idea to  FixMyStreet , where you can report a pothole or fly-tipping, and see your local council's response. Its claim is that 65,000 potholes and other broken things have been meded as a result of its efforts, and just in the last week 1,000 new reports have been lodged with the site.           The energetic Tom Steinberg, the man behind MySociety,\u00a0believes its latest site could prove even more popular, though he admits it is a bit of shot in the dark: \"I just feel instinctively that people are more irritated by overcrowded trains and late buses than by potholes and fly-tipping.\"           Keeping FixMyTransport going if it does take off will require plenty of resources, and the hope is that a volunteer community of the kind that has gathered round other MySociety websites will form to do much of that work.           Mr Steinberg's ideas about using big data projects to engage the public have been watched with interest by the last two governments. \u00a0           There has been a feeling of late that many such projects are of more interest to a small community of data geeks - or to politicians looking for a quick headline - than to the general public.           But MySociety tries to focus on what will appeal to real people.            \"Nobody wakes up thinking they'd really like to explore some interesting data via an attractive visualisation\", says Mr

on a 21st century recipe for urban renewal: Find half a dozen cities struggling to deliver services to citizens in the context of reduced resources. Add a handful of civic coders, a heaping serving of open data and foundation support, start incubating a civic accelerator for startups on the side, and then fold in a brigade of engaged citizens. Mix in of civic pride and then serve on mobile devices with a side of technology-fueled optimism. \n\n \n\n As with any recipe that has, however, your results may vary --- and preparation is critical. The fledgling nonprofit -- in of itself a new kind of civic startup -- learned any number of important lessons in its inaugural year, as Nick Judd documented in his feature on  Code for America, one year on , from culture classes to procurement issues to data availability.  \n\n \n\n \"I'd say the most important thing we learned is that, despite the commonly portrayed caricature of uncaring government bureaucrats, there are many, many truly innovative, risk-taking public servants who work in government,\"  said  Jennifer Pahlka , the founder of  Code for America . The Huffington Post named Pahlka one of the  ultimate gamer changers in business and technology  in 2011. \n\n \n\n \"It's not because they couldn't get a better job but because they believe in this institution that serves us all. \u00a0It's been inspiring. \u00a0There is a lot wrong with the systems in which our public servants work, but there's a lot right in the community of people working to change how our tax dollars are spent and provide better outcomes for the citizens they serve. \u00a0We're honored to get to work with more of them next year, both through the fellowship program and through efforts like the Civic Commons Marketplace.\" \n\n \n\n After a year in which its first fellows spread out across the country, breaking new ground in a new kind of public service, Code for America is now expanding the scope of its efforts with the infusion of $1.5 million dollars of funding from Google.org. \n\n \n\n \"Google's funding will help us expand the fellowship,\" said Pahlka. \"In 2012, we'll go from three cities to eight, and from 19 fellows to 26. \u00a0The Google grant joins with grants already committed from the Knight Foundation and others who are making this expanded scope possible in the coming year.\"  \n\n \n\n Google's donation also will provide the initial funding for two new programs, she explained. \u00a0\"The first program is a seed accelerator, a bit like Y Combinator or Tech Stars, but specifically for civic startups. The second program is what we're calling the Code for America Brigade.\" \n\n \n\n  A Way for More Citizens to Code for America  \n\n \n\n While Code for America has been getting great press and huge interest from potential fellows -- it was harder to get into the non-profit's second class than Harvard last year -- there have been some challenges. One of them is figuring out how to scale to work with more of the general public around the country. \n\n \n\n \"The problem is essentially that way more people want to 'code for America' than our program can currently accommodate,\" said Pahlka.\u00a0\"The CfA Fellowship had 550 applicants this year, and we were only able to accept 26 fellows. That's in addition to all the amazing developers and designers who want to be able to bring open data and civic apps to their communities in their spare time without leaving their jobs and families to come do our year-long fellowship program. \u00a0While eight cities next year is a huge jump from three last year, there are over 10,000 municipalities in the country. Each of them could have a team of involved digital citizens working to stand up applications that make their communities each a better place to live: transit apps, open government apps, public art apps, apps that make it easy to find and use government services. \u00a0Now that we're several years into this movement, a large number of these apps already exist, so no community needs to start from scratch. The CfA Brigade will encourage individual civic hackers and community leaders to get together and start by reusing apps already built by their peers in other communities.\" \n\n \n\n The brigade and Civic Commons, which recently was folded into Code for America after its leadership left for other pursuits, could act as an important connective tissue for the nascent civic Web in the United States and beyond,  particularly with respect to building upon the foundation of civic applications that currently exist.  \n\n \n\n \"We look at some of the great apps that the 2011 Code for America fellows developed, like a mobile app that takes you on a walking tour of the public art in your city,and some of the great apps that have come out of contests like Apps for Communities and various hackathons, and we ask why these apps can't be available in every community in the U.S.,\" said Pahlka. \"The Code for America Brigade will not only enable these apps to spread, but support the development of strong civic coding communities everywhere.\" \n\n \n\n Code for America made an important hire to coordinate this work: Kevin Curry, the founder of CityCamp. \"Kevin has been running CityCamps, unconferences for local governments and communities to collaborate around open data and civic apps, for the past two years,\" said Pahlka. \"He already understands the dynamics of communities following this path, and the CfA Brigade is really a platform to accelerate the work he's already been doing. Kevin's just getting started but we're really excited to see what he and the team will make happen.\" \n\n \n\n The first big effort from Curry and his compatriots will come this weekend, when Code for America is convening a nationwide \"Day of Civic Innovation.\" On February 25, CfA will host \" Code Across America , coordinating 15 events for \"urbanists, civic hackers, city reps, developers, designers and anyone with the passion and motivation to improve their city\" all around the country.\u00a0 \n\n \n\n \"People with web talent and a sense of civic duty can be found throughout the country. If every city could orchestrate such enthusiasm and willingness to participate to improve one's community then American cities would be more tech-savvy than the Silicon Valley,\" said Kevin Curry, program director for the Code for America Brigade. \"Code Across America joins hundreds of people working together to deploy applications that will improve our cities and our society, to build a civic web.\" \n\n \n\n Information and registration for events during this  week of civic innovation , is available at  codeforamerica.org/code-for-america . \n\n \n\n  A Civic Accelerator and the Next Killer Civic App  \n\n \n\n As James Temple reported for the  San Francisco Chronicle , the  apply here  -- Pahlka sees an opportunity beyond civic coders: She's encouraging civic entrepreneurs to help make government work better for citizens. \n\n \n\n \"For government to get back on the innovation curve with the rest of society, we need startups to innovate and even disrupt the government ecosystem,\" she said. \u00a0\"Entrepreneurs have the opportunity to provide real value and build successful businesses in this market, but many need help understanding the opportunities and building the right business models. \u00a0The Code for America Accelerator makes not only entrepreneurs but also investors aware of the opportunities, selects a few companies to bring through the process, and will get a small number of civic startups off the ground in 2012.\" \n\n\n\n \n\n Last July, Pahlka gave a talk at the Future of Web Apps conference in Las Vegas, embedded below, where she explained more of her thinking on this theme: \n\n\n\n \n\n In our interview, Pahlka highlighted how the software made by a more well known company are providing a useful service many citizens during tax season. \"You might not think of something like TurboTax as a civic venture, but that product took a confusing interface to a government process and made it simpler and easier to use for citizens,\" she said. \"Later, it had an impact on the efficiency of government itself as it drove the adoption of e-filing by the IRS. We think of it as an early example. Some [civic startups] will have business models in which government is the customer, some will have citizen-side revenue models, others might even rely on advertising, but what each civic startup should have in common is the potential to disrupt the government ecosystem and create a better experience for government and its citizens.\" \n\n \n\n Pahlka noted that the market for startups focusing on the government customer is sizable but comes with some caveats, particularly with respect to procurement. \"Total annual IT spending in government is estimated at $140 billion,\" she said,\" and governments at all levels are under pressure to find more cost-efficient solutions. There's significant opportunity, but entrepreneurs need to be willing to understand the needs of public sector clients, which can be harder to discover than enterprise or consumer demand.\" Pahlka thinks that\u00a0an accelerator program that leverages advisors who understand the government market can make a significant different from entrepreneurs and investors alike. \n\n \n\n \"Some of these startups will follow the TurboTax model, which essentially bypasses government as a client and creates a better interface for citizens,\" she said. The market here is as large as you want to define it. \u00a0The question we have for entrepreneurs is 'What interface can you improve?' SeeClickFix and CitySourced are doing this for issue reporting. Who will step up to fix business permitting, or other onerous government processes?\" \n\n \n\n Given the economic pressures and challenges that confront hundreds of millions of Americans, the need for a killer civic \"app for that\" may never have been greater. By the end of the year, a majority of citizens are likely to own smartphones, making them full participants in a new app economy that is set to reach into the tens of billions of dollars worldwide. Given the explosion of mobile devices, cloud computing and wireless broadband, as more spectrum is released in the coming years, there's a clear opportunity to apply open data for the public good in industries that span healthcare, finance, transportation and education -- and to create some jobs and profits along the way. \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tFollow Alexander Howard on Twitter:\n\n"}, {"full_text_rss": 0, "media_id": 1, "description": "New York Times reporters identify some of the most powerful figures in the New York region and explains why they wield political influence and ambition.

BENJAMIN WEISER\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tTransportation | Alison Cohen (Rising Star)\n\n \t\t\t\t\tWhen it comes to transportation, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's legacy is riding on two wheels -- and Alison Cohen will largely determine how the mayor is judged. Since 2008, Mr. Bloomberg has been trying to roll out a bike-share program. Ms. Cohen, 37, is president of Alta Bicycle Share, the third-party vendor selected last year to create the oft-delayed system, which will eventually bring 10,000 bikes to 600 stations in the city, starting this summer.\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tWith no city financing, Ms. Cohen has been scrambling to find $50 million in sponsorships. She has also been trying to persuade community boards and local groups to embrace her plans to devote precious street and sidewalk space to bike stations, with an avalanche of planning meetings and open houses in the city. ''She has established a lot of trust with a lot of very skeptical New Yorkers,'' said Paul Steely White, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, a bicycling and public-transit advocacy organization. (She earns points by biking to meetings.)\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tMs. Cohen has drive. She held her Pennsylvania high school's scoring record in basketball -- until it was broken by Kobe Bryant. She played tennis professionally and worked for Goldman Sachs before starting bike-share programs in Boston, Washington and Melbourne, Australia.\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tThe program ''will cement the importance of the mayor's vision that New York should be a city not just where people come to work, but where families and residents, tourists, visitors can enjoy the city together,'' said Kathryn Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, a business group. CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tImmigration | Dream Activists (Rising Star)\n\n \t\t\t\t\tAmong the residents of New York, there may be no population with less power than illegal immigrants. Most live in the shadows of society, trying to avoid the kind of scrutiny that might lead to their deportation.\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tBut some illegal immigrants have cast off their anonymity: the Dream activists. The name comes from proposed federal legislation known as the Dream Act, which would create a path to legal status for young illegal immigrants who go to college or serve in the military. The legislation has surfaced in various forms over the past decade and has been repeatedly defeated, but some states have passed or, like New York, are considering versions that would make young illegal immigrants eligible for financial aid at public colleges and universities.\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tHundreds of Dream activists, working individually and under the banner of youth-led groups like the New York State Youth Leadership Council and United We Dream, have become the face of the campaign, organizing demonstrations, lobbying politicians and sharing their personal stories in the news media. They include the scores of people who, at their own peril, rallied in March outside Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's office in support of the legislation; the group that walked last month to Albany from New York City to raise awareness of their cause; and the 10 City University of New York students, all illegal immigrants, who came forward in March to accept Dream Fellowships.\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tMr. Cuomo has been noncommittal on the legislation so far. But regardless of whether it passes, supporters say the Dream activists have irrevocably changed the complexion of the immigration debate in New York. KIRK SEMPLE\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tHealth | Dr. Thomas A. Farley (Established Player)\t\t \n\n\n\n                 \n\n While all eyes are on Europe, Room for Debate asks, is a quieter crisis brewing in China and India? \n\n\n\n                 \n\n In Room for Debate: the pride and shame of 50-somethings who are still perfecting that ollie at the skate park. \n\n\n\n.\n\n \t\t\t\t\tDr. Thomas A. Farley, the city's health commissioner, is the man behind those graphic anti-obesity ads on the subway, the crackdown on smoking at parks and beaches, and arguably the demise of the communal cheese pot at Sardi's. Dr. Farley and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a calorie-conscious ex-smoker, may not always be the first to carry out initiatives like posting letter grades for restaurants (Los Angeles, for example, had already done that), but with New York as their testing ground, they have an outsize influence on the public health policy conversation around the globe. (And laugh all you want, but since 2000, two years before Mr. Bloomberg took office, the life expectancy for New Yorkers at birth has risen by nearly three years, compared with about 1.5 years nationwide.)\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tAt meetings, Dr. Farley said, his staff is often approached by health officials from other places, ''and they'll say, 'What's the next big idea?' ''\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tDr. Farley, 56, an infectious-disease specialist, came to New York from the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine three years ago, as the swine-flu pandemic was spreading. He is an avid biker, swimmer and runner, with a marathon time of 3 hours 25 minutes. His approach to public health has its share of critics, including smokers and anti-hunger advocates, who say that in his zeal to fight obesity with proposals like banning the use of food stamps to buy soda (that one failed), he runs the risk of stigmatizing poor people. (The decision to remove the free cheese at Sardi's ended with a ''did not, did too'' argument over whether the health department's intricate rules about temperature and sharing food were to blame.)\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tHis next target? ''Prescription painkillers,'' he said. ''Really a national epidemic.'' ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tParks | Patricia E. Harris (Established Player)\n\n \t\t\t\t\tWhile the city parks department's budget for maintenance and operations has been slashed by $54 million in the past four years, capital spending on parks -- the purview of the first deputy mayor, Patricia E. Harris -- has gone emphatically in the other direction. Over the past decade, the city has spent $112 million on the first two sections of the High Line, allotted $208 million for Brooklyn Bridge Park and disbursed $60 million to Governors Island while committing $306 million through 2021.\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tThe parks department is only part of Ms. Harris's portfolio; she also oversees the Landmarks Preservation Commission and the Consumer Affairs, the Cultural Affairs and the Design and Construction Departments.\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tJust as outside observers point to Ms. Harris, 56, she points to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. ''Parks were always a very important part of the city for him,'' she said. ''When he became mayor, he said, 'This is a priority for our administration.' ''\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tThe parks agenda was laid out in PlaNYC, a 2007 manifesto that spawned, among other things, initiatives to plant a million trees, convert schoolyards to playgrounds and pour $291 million into eight regional parks in underserved areas. Total parkland has increased by 725 acres under the Bloomberg administration.\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tHolly M. Leicht, executive director of New Yorkers for Parks, a nonprofit group, called Ms. Harris ''a tremendous advocate for parks,'' saying she had been ''vital to keeping the administration's signature projects on track in this time of drastic budget cuts.'' LISA W. FODERARO\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tThe Bronx | Carl E. Heastie (Rising Star)\n\n \t\t\t\t\tYellow-cab drivers may not like Carl E. Heastie, the six-term assemblyman from the Bronx who has helped to lead efforts to expand livery pickups in northern Manhattan and the other boroughs.\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tBut political insiders say Mr. Heastie's power lies in his ability to unite the famously fractious Bronx, where rival political families have taken grudge-holding to new levels (Example A: the D\u00edaz versus Espada saga). Now, for the first time in years, there is a truce in the borough, with political leaders not just on speaking terms but also actively working toward common goals like economic development.\t\t \n\n\n\n                 \n\n While all eyes are on Europe, Room for Debate asks, is a quieter crisis brewing in China and India? \n\n\n\n                 \n\n In Room for Debate: the pride and shame of 50-somethings who are still perfecting that ollie at the skate park. \n\n\n\n.\n\n \t\t\t\t\tFor this special issue, the Metropolitan section asked the reporters who cover the New York region to identify the powerful figures on their beats, and to explain what gave them clout and where they fell on the chain of influence in New York. A separate article identifies those figures who earned the highest spot in our power pantheon: heavy hitters. The rest, arranged alphabetically below, are either established players or rising stars.\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tDesign | Antenna Design (Rising Star)\n\n \t\t\t\t\tIn a square, one-room office on West 23rd Street, two rarely seen faces wield untold influence over the daily lives of millions of New Yorkers. They are Masamichi Udagawa and Sigi Moeslinger, and if you ride the subways, chances are that their work influences the quality of this most intimate human encounter.\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tMr. Udagawa, 47, and Ms. Moeslinger, 44, are the principals of Antenna Design, the company behind the last major changes to New York's subway cars, in 2000 and 2006. Of the city's 6,374 subway cars, 3,504 bear the pair's interior and exterior designs, as do MetroCard vending machines and other accouterments of underground life. These are people who obsess about the effects of steel dust on MetroCard readers or the ways light and color can influence riders' moods.\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t''We subscribe to the idea of City Beautiful,'' Mr. Udagawa said, referring to an architectural and urban-planning movement from the 1890s and 1900s that sought to use attractive design to make people better citizens. ''It promotes the idea that a nice environment creates nice behavior.''\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tDoing that underground, in a crowded, smelly subway system, presents challenges. ''A simple trick can go a long way,'' Mr. Udagawa said. ''The new trains have a glossy black floor and light ceilings and walls, which make the space feel bigger than it is.''\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tThe two designed cars with digital station listings to help passengers track their progress, and with diagonal metal bars by the doors because, Ms. Moeslinger said, if the bars were horizontal, riders would climb them. ''We're trying to lead people to behavior,'' she said. ''But there are limits to how much design can control the situation. Then you have to come in with rules and regulations.'' JOHN LELAND\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tReligion | The Rev. A. R. Bernard (Established Player)\n\n \t\t\t\t\tThe Rev. A. R. Bernard, pastor of the 36,000-member Christian Cultural Center in southeast Brooklyn, can identify, it seems, with half the city. He is Panamanian by birth, but a New Yorker since age 4. African-American, but also of white and Latino heritage. Republican, but he voted for Barack Obama. A born-again Christian, but once a member of the Nation of Islam. He spreads the Gospel, but is close with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who is Jewish, and speaks with him roughly every other week. ''We clicked,'' Mr. Bernard said.\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tMr. Bernard, 59, is an adept political force in New York City, a preacher who would rather guide public policy behind the scenes than shout about it in front of the cameras. His discretion and his willingness to work with people with whom he disagrees on some matters -- like, he said, Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker who is a lesbian -- have made him a moderate in the evangelical Christian world, and a sought-after bridge between liberal politicians and more conservative constituencies. (His church is the largest in the region.)\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tMr. Bernard lives in Smithtown, on Long Island, and cannot vote in the city, but he endorsed Mr. Bloomberg in all three of his campaigns. He has not yet decided if he will back anyone in the coming mayoral race, but the hopefuls have come courting. What is he looking for? ''Competence and passion,'' he said. SHARON OTTERMAN\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tFederal Court | Preet Bharara (Rising Star)\n\n \t\t\t\t\tIn the past year, Preet Bharara,the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, has done more than anyone to affect New York's political landscape -- and he has never held elected office.\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tAs Manhattan's chief federal prosecutor, Mr. Bharara, 43, is best known for his aggressive prosecution of Wall Street crime, but he has also won corruption convictions against State Senator Carl Kruger of Brooklyn, once the powerful chairman of the Senate Finance Committee; the lobbyist Richard J. Lipsky, a ubiquitous presence in Albany and City Hall; and four other defendants in a political bribery scandal. The mayoral aspirations of Comptroller John C. Liu have been hampered as Mr. Bharara investigates his campaign finances. (Mr. Liu has not been accused of wrongdoing; his former campaign treasurer was indicted last month.) And in March, a former Yonkers councilwoman was convicted in another corruption case.\t\t \n\n\n\n                 \n\n While all eyes are on Europe, Room for Debate asks, is a quieter crisis brewing in China and India? \n\n\n\n                 \n\n In Room for Debate: the pride and shame of 50-somethings who are still perfecting that ollie at the skate park. \n\n\n\n.\n\n \t\t\t\t\tSome judges and lawyers fear Judge Lippman because he knows the administrative machinery that court officials can use to punish and reward. New York's liberal establishment has been largely neutralized as a source of criticism because he has staked out a progressive role, not only in individual cases, but also on causes like increasing state financing for lawyers who represent poor people. He is also a schmoozer who has had lunch with Donald Trump and breakfast with Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan. ''He has a political sense to know where to push and what to push for,'' said Vincent E. Doyle III, president of the State Bar Association. And when he calls, Mr. Doyle said, ''he calls me Vinnie.'' WILLIAM GLABERSON\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tLabor | Michael Mulgrew (Rising Star)\n\n \t\t\t\t\tWhen a city politician speaks about schools, you can be sure a conversation with Michael Mulgrew happened first. Mr. Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers, the city's largest union of public school workers, has become one of the most influential figures in New York education, the hot topic of next year's mayoral race.\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tLabor has fallen out of favor in City Hall thanks to a wealthy mayor who does not depend on unions' donations or their formidable get-out-the-vote efforts, but that will change in 2013, when the race could be decided in a Democratic primary with heavy turnout from the left-leaning teachers' union, which has 200,000 active and retired members.\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tMr. Mulgrew, 46, a Staten Island native, has already started running television advertisements, and he is training his guidance counselors and secretaries in the electoral arts of leafleting and phone banking. Recently, he drew headlines by attacking Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, for employing consultants who also work for a nonprofit group supportive of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's school policies.\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tHe plans to endorse a mayoral candidate, unlike in 2009, when the union declined to pick a favorite. And polls show that voters trust the union over the mayor to protect students' interests. MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tEconomic Development | Seth W. Pinsky (Rising Star)\n\n \t\t\t\t\tSlightly built, soft-spoken and unfailingly courteous, Seth W. Pinsky, 40, seems ill suited to drag New York City's economy back from the brink of financial crisis. But for the past four years, that has been his task as president of the Economic Development Corporation, and the biggest idea he has championed has been to build an engineering school from scratch on some underused city property.\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tAfter the Lehman Brothers investment bank failed in 2008, persuading a world-class university to invest heavily in New York seemed far-fetched. But Mr. Pinsky's persistence resulted in an offer that brought Stanford University, among others, calling, and the city regained some of its luster. Who could turn down the chance to claim Stanford's first degree-granting campus this side of Silicon Valley?\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tIt turned out that Mr. Pinsky could. Not swayed by Stanford's cachet, he and his negotiating team insisted on stiff penalties if the university did not meet its promises in setting up shop on Roosevelt Island. Stanford balked, and now, Cornell University plans to build a $2 billion campus in the same spot. Mr. Pinsky said he was ''100 percent satisfied with where the process ended up.''\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tIn April, he had the bonus of standing beside Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to announce that the city had gotten ''two for one,'' because New York University plans to open an ''urban science'' school in Downtown Brooklyn. PATRICK McGEEHAN\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tReal Estate | Stephen M. Ross (Established Player)\n\n \t\t\t\t\tThe developer Stephen M. Ross is not afraid of a fight. Mr. Ross, 72, the chairman and chief executive of Related Companies, has clashed with fellow developers like Donald Trump and Joseph Moinian, and has wrestled with New York's powerful construction unions over wages and work rules. Now, at the planned $15 billion, 26-acre Hudson Yards development on the West Side of Manhattan, he is trying to overhaul the way projects are built in the city by getting more concessions from the unions and by eliminating subcontractors, cutting a traditional layer of costs.\t\t \n\n\n\n                 \n\n While all eyes are on Europe, Room for Debate asks, is a quieter crisis brewing in China and India? \n\n\n\n                 \n\n In Room for Debate: the pride and shame of 50-somethings who are still perfecting that ollie at the skate park. \n\n\n\n.\n\n \t\t\t\t\tIt is unclear if he will win, but it is hard to bet against him. Mr. Ross and his partners at Related built the $1.7 billion Time Warner Center -- twin 80-story towers at Columbus Circle with shops, a hotel and luxury apartments -- after a 16-year battle over the site, and he is trying to revive the long-stalled transformation of the James A. Farley Post Office into Moynihan Station. In his latest scheme, he has offered to build Borough of Manhattan Community College a larger campus inside the post office in exchange for the school's land downtown.\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tIn fact, Related is juggling six projects in the city right now, including the first phase of Hunters Point South, the largest affordable-housing complex built in New York since the 1970s. On the weekends, Mr. Ross has been trying to turn the Miami Dolphins, the N.F.L. franchise he bought for $1.1 billion, into a championship team. CHARLES V. BAGLI\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tEconomic Sector | Tech Companies (Rising Star)\n\n \t\t\t\t\tA prime example of the rise of New York's tech companies from economic engine to civic presence is the board of the New York City Investment Fund. When the fund was founded 16 years ago to funnel city elites' energy and money into public projects, its board was filled with the usual do-gooders from the real estate, financial and legal industries. Now two seats belong to members of the Internet community: Kevin P. Ryan, chief executive of the online retailer Gilt Groupe, and Fred Wilson, a founding partner of the venture capital firm Union Square Ventures.\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t''What's happening is that as tech in New York becomes bigger and more mature, some people are getting more successful and more plugged in,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''And so the sector as a whole has more seats at the table.''\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tSometimes this involves mayoral candidates like Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, or Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, dropping by the Gilt Groupe offices for the ''you're on our radar'' conversations commonly conducted with more traditionally deep-pocketed industries. Other times it means nationally known politicians like Charles E. Schumer, New York's senior senator, checking in on net neutrality or other digital issues.\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tWhile the tech industry has spawned a few influential (and donation-ready) fortunes, smaller companies believe they have a different kind of clout. In November, for example, when Congress held a hearing on the Stop Online Piracy Act, Tumblr, a micro-blogging site based in New York, put an icon on its home page that allowed users, with a single click, to call their elected representatives directly to complain. In one day, 90,000 users did so.\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tAndrew McLaughlin, former deputy chief technology officer for President Obama and now a vice president at Tumblr, said the ''start-uppy, more nimble'' parts of the sector were starting to practice what he called ''civic hacking.''\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tTo capitalize on tech's newfound muscle, Brad Burnham, Mr. Wilson's partner at Union Square Ventures, recently recruited an advocate -- he avoided the word ''lobbyist'' -- to represent the industry's concerns. The advocate, Nick Grossman, will be based at and partly financed by Union Square Ventures. His mandate, Mr. Burnham said, will be ''to alert people to issues and to organize opposition to ones detrimental'' to the tech sector.\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tMr. Burnham added, ''We want to use the Internet to save the Internet.'' ALAN FEUER\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tEducation | Merryl H. Tisch (Established Player)\n\n \t\t\t\t\tA friend of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's and an advocate of many of his education reforms, Merryl H. Tisch is also the highest-ranking thorn in the mayor's side from her post as chancellor of the New York State Board of Regents.\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tTake school improvement grants: federal money given to failing schools by the Obama administration. While visiting one city recipient, Ms. Tisch, 56, called schools like it ''warehouses'' for struggling students, who were put there after the city closed the schools they used to attend. She admitted to regretting her choice of words as they came out of her mouth, but said she did not regret the ensuing debate. ''The ultimate result was to have a much better conversation,'' she said.\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tShe said that the differences between her and the mayor were often smaller than people thought, and that they arose because the Bloomberg administration was so goal-oriented. ''I think they believe that policy gets in the way of the choices they would like to make,'' she said. ''In our judgment, those choices are sometimes superb, and sometimes we question those choices.''\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tOne of those choices has been Mr. Bloomberg's expansion of charter schools. ''Creating choice has been an invaluable tool in improving school results,'' Ms. Tisch said, but she wondered aloud about the unintended consequences of the policy. ''In addition to choice is more focus on the good work in public schools and supporting them,'' she said.\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tMs. Tisch will be around to prod the next mayor, too: her term on the Board of Regents does not expire until 2016.

''There are two ways that political leaders try to accomplish their goals,'' said Jeffrey Dinowitz, a state assemblyman from the Bronx who works closely with Mr. Heastie. ''One way is to yell and scream, and that's not his way. The other way is to try to bring people together.''

But with the 2012 elections just six months away, Mr. Israel, 52, has become the chief architect of the party's efforts to retake control of the House, where Republicans have held the majority since the 2010 midterm elections.\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tAs chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Mr. Israel has a role in tailoring his party's national message, controls millions of dollars in campaign money and is turning grateful candidates across the nation into potential allies.\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tBut the job is not without risk. Come November, Mr. Israel will be judged, fairly or not, on whether Democrats pick up the 25 seats they need to reclaim the majority in the House.\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tIn some respects, Mr. Israel is an odd choice for such a partisan job. Over six terms in Congress, he has earned a reputation as a centrist representing a modest district of bedroom communities on Long Island.\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tBut he is also ambitious and energetic. Two years ago, he was ready to defy his party's leadership and stage a primary challenge against Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, who had been appointed to fill the seat vacated by Hillary Rodham Clinton. He backed down only after President Obama intervened.\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tMr. Israel has another important qualification: He is a fierce fund-raiser. Since taking the helm of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee 16 months ago, the committee has raised about $83.6 million -- about $10 million more than the House Republicans' campaign organization. RAYMOND HERNANDEZ\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tBrooklyn | Hakeem Jeffries (Rising Star)\n\n \t\t\t\t\tHakeem Jeffries, a state assemblyman, is the front-runner in the race for the Brooklyn Congressional seat held for 15 terms by Representative Edolphus Towns, with a $400,000 campaign chest. Winning would make him the representative of a heavily black district in a borough where blacks are the largest reliably Democratic ethnic group, and would give him a grip on federal dollars for housing and jobs. Mr. Jeffries, 41, a former lawyer at the Paul Weiss firm, is politically moderate and untouched by scandal, and can talk to the gentrifiers in Clinton Hill and Fort Greene and to the Hasidim in Crown Heights. ''He has the potential to swing a much larger bat in the power game than any of the black leaders in Brooklyn,'' said Norman Adler, a Democratic political consultant.\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tIn the State Assembly, Mr. Jeffries sponsored a bill, passed in 2010, that prohibited the police from collecting data on people stopped and frisked but not charged with a crime, a major issue for minority voters. He lives in Prospect Heights with his wife and two sons, and he may have higher political ambitions, judging by his observation in an interview that the city's black power center had shifted from Harlem. ''This is an opportunity for a new generation of African-American leaders to emerge who can advance the interests of our community but appeal to a broader group of individuals,'' he said. JOSEPH BERGER\t\t \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tNew York Courts | Jonathan Lippman (Established Player)\n\n \t\t\t\t\tThe job of the state's chief judge, Jonathan Lippman, who leads not only New York's highest court but also its vast judicial bureaucracy, by definition comes with clout. But in Judge Lippman's 11 years as the top administrator under the last chief judge, Judith S. Kaye, he learned his way around the halls of power. Three years into his tenure as Judge Kaye's successor, Judge Lippman, 66, has used that savvy to become, in the eyes of many, a bigger player than she was outside the courtroom on policy, budgetary, administrative and legislative issues.\t\t \n\n\n\n                 \n\n While all eyes are on Europe, Room for Debate asks, is a quieter crisis brewing in China and India? \n\n\n\n                 \n\n In Room for Debate: the pride and shame of 50-somethings who are still perfecting that ollie at the skate park. \n\n\n\n"}, {"full_text_rss": 0, "media_id": 1, "description": "The Orthodox Jewish

As part of a  special issue of Metropolitan , here\u2019s a look at who is at the top and who may be on the way, as identified by the reporters of The New York Times. \n\n \n\n Clockwise from top left: the officials Patricia E. Harris, Raymond W. Kelly and Merryl H. Tisch; and the newer faces Masamichi Udagawa, Sigi Moeslinger and Hakeem Jeffries. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n Whoever holds the mayor\u2019s office next will chart New York\u2019s direction. But succeeding Mr. Bloomberg is not the same as replacing him. His enormous wealth has enhanced his influence to a degree that no other political figure on the horizon can equal. \n\n \n\n Still, it is worth understanding where else in the city power lies, the subject of this special issue of Metropolitan. \n\n \n\n Entire classes of influence-mongers \u2014 religious leaders, representatives of ethnic and racial groups \u2014 are less formidable than they were in the past. A positive spin on that fact would be that we are now more democratic. But the diffusion of power also means that major projects often take years, even decades, to be completed, if they are built at all. \n\n \n\n Political bosses? The very phrase seems as quaint as smoke-filled rooms and spittoons. Who replaced  Carmine De Sapio  as the boss of the Tammany Hall political machine? No one. For that matter, a young New Yorker might well ask, What\u2019s  Tammany Hall ? \n\n \n\n Among labor leaders there is no one like the    United Federation of Teachers \u2019    Albert Shanker  to inspire a good New York inside joke like the one in    Woody Allen \u2019s  \u201cSleeper\u201d  about how life on earth changed forever when Mr. Shanker \u201cgot hold of a nuclear warhead.\u201d \n\n \n\n The diffused influence has been accelerated by the Internet, and especially by social media: forces that made possible a phenomenon like the    Occupy Wall Street  movement, which got us all talking about the 99 percent. But does making your presence felt in a street protest qualify as true power? The Occupy movement committed itself to  shutting down the city on May Day  last week. It didn\u2019t come close. \n\n\n\n \n\n Mr. Bloomberg has not given any indication of what he will do next, but he is unlikely to simply walk away from the public sphere. Maybe he will continue to exert influence and shape policies through his  foundation . Maybe he will focus more attention on his media company. Or maybe he will work behind the scenes to ensure that his preferred successor wins in 2013 \u2014 and, therefore, owes him a substantial political debt.    \n\n \n\n \u201cThat\u2019s just a sampling,\u201d said Paul J. Browne, the aide who provided the list and serves as the department\u2019s chief spokesman. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to overwhelm you with any more.\u201d \n\n \n\n Polls reflect Mr. Kelly\u2019s continuing popularity, ratings that are the envy of politicians, even as he endured waves of turmoil last year over corruption scandals, the department\u2019s street-stop and surveillance methods, and a level of budget-cutting that has shrunk the force to 35,000 officers from more than  40,000 in 2000.   \n\n \n\n On April 20,    President Obama \u2019s top counterterrorism adviser,    John O. Brennan , came to 1 Police Plaza and expressed support for Mr. Kelly, saying the \u201c   N.Y.P.D.  does tremendous work, day in and day out.\u201d \n\n \n\n As he was in 2008, Mr. Kelly has been suggested as a mayoral contender for next year\u2019s run for City Hall, though he has not publicly expressed interest in the office. \n\n \n\n In a square, one-room office on West 23rd Street, two rarely seen faces wield untold influence over the daily lives of millions of New Yorkers. They are Masamichi Udagawa and Sigi Moeslinger, and if you ride the subways, chances are that their work influences the quality of this most intimate human encounter. \n\n \n\n Mr. Udagawa, 47, and Ms. Moeslinger, 44, are the principals of Antenna Design,  the company  behind the last major changes to New York\u2019s subway cars, in  2000  and  2006 . Of the city\u2019s 6,374 subway cars, 3,504 bear the pair\u2019s interior and exterior designs, as do    MetroCard  vending machines and other accouterments of underground life. These are people who obsess about the effects of steel dust on MetroCard readers or the ways light and color can influence riders\u2019 moods. \n\n \n\n \u201cWe subscribe to the idea of City Beautiful,\u201d Mr. Udagawa said, referring to  an architectural and urban-planning movement  from the 1890s and 1900s that sought to use attractive design to make people better citizens. \u201cIt promotes the idea that a nice environment creates nice behavior.\u201d \n\n \n\n Doing that underground, in a crowded, smelly subway system, presents challenges. \u201cA simple trick can go a long way,\u201d Mr. Udagawa said. \u201cThe new trains have a glossy black floor and light ceilings and walls, which make the space feel bigger than it is.\u201d \n\n \n\n The two designed cars with digital station listings to help passengers track their progress, and with diagonal metal bars by the doors because, Ms. Moeslinger said, if the bars were horizontal, riders would climb them. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to lead people to behavior,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there are limits to how much design can control the situation. Then you have to come in with rules and regulations.\u201d\n\n \n\n Rose Gill Hearn, commissioner of the city\u2019s Department of Investigation, which referred the CityTime case to Mr. Bharara and regularly sends corruption matters his way, said: \u201cHe reaches out: \u2018Let\u2019s meet.\u2019 \u2018Let\u2019s talk.\u2019 I think he understands that there are significant cases being generated by D.O.I., and he wants to do them.\u201d\n\n \n\n With no city financing, Ms. Cohen has been scrambling to find $50 million in sponsorships. She has also been trying to persuade community boards and local groups to embrace her plans to devote precious street and sidewalk space to bike stations, with an avalanche of  planning meetings and open houses  in the city. \u201cShe has established a lot of trust with a lot of very skeptical New Yorkers,\u201d said Paul Steely White, executive director of  Transportation Alternatives , a bicycling and public-transit advocacy organization. (She earns points by biking to meetings.) \n\n \n\n Ms. Cohen has drive. She held her    Pennsylvania  high school\u2019s scoring record in basketball \u2014 until it was broken by    Kobe Bryant . She played tennis professionally and worked for    Goldman Sachs  before starting bike-share programs in  Boston ,  Washington  and  Melbourne ,    Australia . \n\n \n\n The program \u201cwill cement the importance of the mayor\u2019s vision that New York should be a city not just where people come to work, but where families and residents, tourists, visitors can enjoy the city together,\u201d said Kathryn Wylde, president of  the Partnership for New York City , a business group.\n\n \n\n Among the residents of New York, there may be no population with less power than illegal immigrants. Most live in the shadows of society, trying to avoid the kind of scrutiny that might lead to their deportation. \n\n \n\n But some illegal immigrants have cast off their anonymity: the Dream activists. The name comes from proposed federal legislation known as  the Dream Act , which would create a path to legal status for young illegal immigrants who go to college or serve in the military. The legislation has surfaced in various forms over the past decade and has been repeatedly defeated, but some states have passed or, like New York, are considering versions that would make young illegal immigrants eligible for financial aid at public colleges and universities. \n\n \n\n Hundreds of Dream activists, working individually and under the banner of youth-led groups like the    New York State  Youth Leadership Council and United We Dream, have become the face of the campaign, organizing demonstrations, lobbying politicians and sharing their personal stories in the news media. They include the scores of people who, at their own peril, rallied in March outside Gov.    Andrew M. Cuomo \u2019s office in support of the legislation; the group that walked last month to Albany from New York City to raise awareness of their cause; and the 10    City University of New York  students, all illegal immigrants, who came forward in March to  accept Dream Fellowships . \n\n \n\n   Mr. Cuomo has been noncommittal  on the legislation so far. But regardless of whether it passes, supporters say the Dream activists have irrevocably changed the complexion of the immigration debate in New York.\n\n   \n\n Yellow-cab drivers may not like Carl E. Heastie, the six-term assemblyman from the Bronx who has helped to lead efforts to  expand livery pickups  in northern Manhattan and the other boroughs. \n\n \n\n But political insiders say Mr. Heastie\u2019s power lies in his ability to unite the famously fractious Bronx, where rival political families have taken grudge-holding to new levels (Example A:  the D\u00edaz versus Espada saga ). Now, for the first time in years, there is a truce in the borough, with political leaders not just on speaking terms but also actively working toward common goals like economic development. \n\n \n\n Mr. Heastie, 44, a native son of the Bronx, was part of a 2008 coalition of politicians that cut across racial, ethnic and socioeconomic lines. Called the \u201cRainbow Rebels\u201d by the news media, they  took control of the Bronx Democratic County Committee  from the forces of the longtime party leader, Jos\u00e9 Rivera. \n\n \n\n Mr. Heastie took over as county leader, and he is said to be a consensus-builder. \u201cThere are two ways that political leaders try to accomplish their goals,\u201d said Jeffrey Dinowitz, a state assemblyman from the Bronx who works closely with Mr. Heastie. \u201cOne way is to yell and scream, and that\u2019s not his way. The other way is to try to bring people together.\u201d\n\n \n\n As chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Mr. Israel has a role in tailoring his party\u2019s national message, controls millions of dollars in campaign money and is turning grateful candidates across the nation into potential allies. \n\n \n\n But the job is not without risk. Come November, Mr. Israel will be judged, fairly or not, on whether Democrats pick up the 25 seats they need to reclaim the majority in the House. \n\n \n\n In some respects, Mr. Israel is an odd choice for such a partisan job. Over six terms in Congress, he has earned a reputation as a centrist representing a modest district of bedroom communities on Long Island. \n\n \n\n But he is also ambitious and energetic. Two years ago, he was ready to defy his party\u2019s leadership and stage a primary challenge against Senator    Kirsten E. Gillibrand , who had been appointed to fill the seat vacated by    Hillary Rodham Clinton . He backed down only after  President Obama intervened . \n\n \n\n Mr. Israel has another important qualification: He is a fierce fund-raiser. Since taking the helm of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee 16 months ago, the committee has raised about $83.6 million \u2014 about $10 million more than the House Republicans\u2019 campaign organization.\n\n \n\n Hakeem Jeffries, a state assemblyman,  is the front-runner  in the race for the Brooklyn Congressional seat held for 15 terms by Representative    Edolphus Towns , with a $400,000 campaign chest. Winning would make him the representative of a heavily black district in a borough where blacks are the largest reliably Democratic ethnic group, and would give him a grip on federal dollars for housing and jobs. Mr. Jeffries, 41, a former lawyer at the Paul Weiss firm, is politically moderate and untouched by scandal, and can talk to the gentrifiers in Clinton Hill and Fort Greene and to the Hasidim in Crown Heights. \u201cHe has the potential to swing a much larger bat in the power game than any of the black leaders in Brooklyn,\u201d said Norman Adler, a Democratic political consultant. \n\n \n\n In the State Assembly, Mr. Jeffries sponsored a bill,  passed in 2010 , that prohibited the police from collecting data on people stopped and frisked but not charged with a crime, a major issue for minority voters. He lives in Prospect Heights with his wife and two sons, and he may have higher political ambitions, judging by his observation in an interview that the city\u2019s black power center had shifted from    Harlem . \u201cThis is an opportunity for a new generation of African-American leaders to emerge who can advance the interests of our community but appeal to a broader group of individuals,\u201d he said.\n\n \n\n Labor has fallen out of favor in City Hall thanks to a wealthy mayor who does not depend on unions\u2019 donations or their formidable get-out-the-vote efforts, but that will change in 2013, when the race could be decided in a Democratic primary with heavy turnout from the left-leaning teachers\u2019 union, which has 200,000 active and retired members. \n\n\n\n \n\n He plans to endorse a mayoral candidate, unlike in 2009, when the union declined to pick a favorite. And polls show that voters trust the union over the mayor to protect students\u2019 interests.\n\n   \n\n Slightly built, soft-spoken and unfailingly courteous, Seth W. Pinsky, 40, seems ill suited to drag New York City\u2019s economy back from the brink of financial crisis. But for the past four years, that has been his task as president of the Economic Development Corporation, and the biggest idea he has championed has been to build an engineering school from scratch on some underused city property. \n\n \n\n After the    Lehman Brothers  investment bank failed in 2008, persuading a world-class university to invest heavily in New York seemed far-fetched. But Mr. Pinsky\u2019s persistence resulted in an offer that brought    Stanford University , among others, calling, and the city regained some of its luster. Who could turn down the chance to claim Stanford\u2019s first degree-granting campus this side of Silicon Valley? \n\n \n\n It turned out that Mr. Pinsky could. Not swayed by Stanford\u2019s cachet, he and his negotiating team insisted on stiff penalties if the university did not meet its promises in setting up shop on Roosevelt Island.  Stanford balked , and now,  Cornell University plans to build  a $2 billion campus in the same spot. Mr. Pinsky said he was \u201c100 percent satisfied with where the process ended up.\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n A prime example of the rise of New York\u2019s tech companies from economic engine to civic presence is the board of the  New York City Investment Fund . When the fund was founded 16 years ago to funnel city elites\u2019 energy and money into public projects, its board was filled with the usual do-gooders from the real estate, financial and legal industries. Now two seats belong to members of the Internet community: Kevin P. Ryan, chief executive of the online retailer  Gilt Groupe , and Fred Wilson, a founding partner of the venture capital firm  Union Square Ventures . \n\n \n\n \u201cWhat\u2019s happening is that as tech in New York becomes bigger and more mature, some people are getting more successful and more plugged in,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cAnd so the sector as a whole has more seats at the table.\u201d \n\n \n\n Sometimes this involves mayoral candidates like Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, or    Bill de Blasio , the public advocate, dropping by the Gilt Groupe offices for the \u201cyou\u2019re on our radar\u201d conversations commonly conducted with more traditionally deep-pocketed industries. Other times it means nationally known politicians like    Charles E. Schumer , New York\u2019s senior senator, checking in on    net neutrality  or other digital issues. \n\n \n\n While the tech industry has spawned a few influential (and donation-ready) fortunes, smaller companies believe they have a different kind of clout. In November, for example, when Congress held a hearing on the  Stop Online Piracy Act , Tumblr, a micro-blogging site based in New York, put an icon on its home page that allowed users, with a single click, to call their elected representatives directly to complain. In one day, 90,000 users did so. \n\n \n\n Andrew McLaughlin, former deputy chief technology officer for President Obama and now a vice president at Tumblr, said the \u201cstart-uppy, more nimble\u201d parts of the sector were starting to practice what he called \u201ccivic hacking.\u201d \n\n \n\n To capitalize on tech\u2019s newfound muscle, Brad Burnham, Mr. Wilson\u2019s partner at Union Square Ventures, recently recruited an advocate \u2014 he avoided the word \u201clobbyist\u201d \u2014 to represent the industry\u2019s concerns. The advocate, Nick Grossman, will be based at and partly financed by Union Square Ventures. His mandate, Mr. Burnham said, will be \u201cto alert people to issues and to organize opposition to ones detrimental\u201d to the tech sector. \n\n \n\n Mr. Burnham added, \u201cWe want to use the Internet to save the Internet.\u201d\n\n \n\n At meetings, Dr. Farley said, his staff is often approached by health officials from other places, \u201cand they\u2019ll say, \u2018What\u2019s the next big idea?\u2019\u00a0\u201c \n\n \n\n Dr. Farley, 56, an infectious-disease specialist,  came to New York  from the    Tulane University  School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine three years ago, as the swine-   flu  pandemic was spreading. He is an avid biker, swimmer and runner, with a marathon time of 3 hours 25 minutes. His approach to public health has its share of critics, including smokers and anti-hunger advocates, who say that in his zeal to fight obesity with proposals like banning the use of food stamps to buy soda (that one failed), he runs the risk of stigmatizing poor people. (The decision to remove the free cheese at Sardi\u2019s ended with  a \u201cdid not, did too\u201d argument  over whether the health department\u2019s intricate rules about temperature and sharing food were to blame.) \n\n\n\n \n\n While the city parks department\u2019s budget for maintenance and operations has been slashed by $54 million in the past four years, capital spending on parks \u2014 the purview of the first deputy mayor, Patricia E. Harris \u2014 has gone emphatically in the other direction. Over the past decade, the city has spent $112 million on the first two sections of  the High Line , allotted $208 million for Brooklyn Bridge Park and disbursed $60 million to Governors Island while committing $306 million through 2021. \n\n\n\n \n\n Just as outside observers point to Ms. Harris, 56, she points to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. \u201cParks were always a very important part of the city for him,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen he became mayor, he said, \u2018This is a priority for our administration.\u2019\u00a0\u201d \n\n \n\n The parks agenda was laid out in  PlaNYC , a 2007 manifesto that spawned, among other things, initiatives to plant a million trees, convert schoolyards to playgrounds and pour $291 million into eight regional parks in underserved areas. Total parkland has increased by 725 acres under the Bloomberg administration. \n\n \n\n Holly M. Leicht, executive director of New Yorkers for Parks, a nonprofit group, called Ms. Harris \u201ca tremendous advocate for parks,\u201d saying she had been \u201cvital to keeping the administration\u2019s signature projects on track in this time of drastic budget cuts.\u201d\n\n   \n\n The job of the state\u2019s chief judge, Jonathan Lippman, who leads not only New York\u2019s highest court but also its vast judicial bureaucracy, by definition comes with clout. But in Judge Lippman\u2019s 11 years as the top administrator under the last chief judge,    Judith S. Kaye , he learned his way around the halls of power. Three years into his tenure as Judge Kaye\u2019s successor, Judge Lippman, 66, has used that savvy to become, in the eyes of many, a bigger player than she was outside the courtroom on policy, budgetary, administrative and legislative issues. \n\n \n\n Some judges and lawyers fear Judge Lippman because he knows the administrative machinery that court officials can use to punish and reward. New York\u2019s liberal establishment has been largely neutralized as a source of criticism because he has staked out a progressive role, not only in individual cases, but also on causes like increasing state financing for lawyers who represent poor people. He is also a schmoozer who has had lunch with    Donald Trump  and breakfast with Cardinal    Timothy M. Dolan . \u201cHe has a political sense to know where to push and what to push for,\u201d said Vincent E. Doyle III, president of the State Bar Association. And when he calls, Mr. Doyle said, \u201che calls me Vinnie.\u201d\n\n \n\n The developer Stephen M. Ross is not afraid of a fight. Mr. Ross, 72, the chairman and chief executive of Related Companies, has clashed with fellow developers like Donald Trump and Joseph Moinian, and has wrestled with New York\u2019s powerful construction unions over wages and work rules. Now, at the planned $15 billion, 26-acre Hudson Yards development on the West Side of Manhattan, he is trying to overhaul the way projects are built in the city by getting more concessions from the unions and by eliminating subcontractors, cutting a traditional layer of costs. \n\n \n\n It is unclear if he will win, but it is hard to bet against him. Mr. Ross and his partners at Related built the $1.7 billion    Time Warner  Center \u2014 twin 80-story towers at Columbus Circle with shops, a hotel and luxury apartments \u2014  after a 16-year battle  over the site, and he is trying to revive  the long-stalled transformation  of the James A. Farley Post Office into Moynihan Station. In his latest scheme, he has offered to build Borough of Manhattan Community College a larger campus inside the post office in exchange for the school\u2019s land downtown. \n\n \n\n In fact, Related is juggling six projects in the city right now, including the first phase of Hunters Point South, the largest affordable-housing complex built in New York since the 1970s. On the weekends, Mr. Ross has been trying to turn the    Miami Dolphins , the    N.F.L.  franchise he bought for $1.1 billion, into a championship team.\n\n \n\n A friend of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg\u2019s and an advocate of many of his education reforms, Merryl H. Tisch is also the highest-ranking thorn in the mayor\u2019s side from her post as chancellor of  the New York State Board of Regents . \n\n \n\n Take school improvement grants: federal money given to failing schools by the Obama administration. While visiting one city recipient, Ms. Tisch, 56, called schools like it  \u201cwarehouses\u201d for struggling students , who were put there after the city closed the schools they used to attend. She admitted to regretting her choice of words as they came out of her mouth, but said she did not regret the ensuing debate. \u201cThe ultimate result was to have a much better conversation,\u201d she said. \n\n \n\n She said that the differences between her and the mayor were often smaller than people thought, and that they arose because the Bloomberg administration was so goal-oriented. \u201cI think they believe that policy gets in the way of the choices they would like to make,\u201d she said. \u201cIn our judgment, those choices are sometimes superb, and sometimes we question those choices.\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n Ms. Tisch will be around to prod the next mayor, too: her term on the Board of Regents does not expire until 2016.\n\n \n\n Amid the special circumstances of the elections, one outcome was clear: \u201cThe Orthodox community has emerged as a stand-alone force that needs to be reckoned with,\u201d said Ezra Friedlander, who runs a public-affairs consulting company. \n\n\n\n \n\n The Orthodox community, led by younger social media-aware voters, tends to focus on social services like tuition assistance for yeshivas, busing and housing, but votes socially conservative on issues like same-sex marriage. Their numbers are growing. According to the census, since the previous count, Borough Park was the one neighborhood in the city with more than 100,000 people that grew, by 5.2 percent. \n\n \n\n The Orthodox influence will likely be diluted on the state level, at least, by redistricting, which has concentrated the Orthodox of south Brooklyn into a \u201cSuper Jewish\u201d district. \n\n\n\n \n\n \u201cI don\u2019t think the Orthodox community has made up its mind who it will support,\u201d Mr. Friedlander said. \u201cNo candidate should take the Orthodox community for granted.\u201d\n\n \n\n Nobody calls the cardinal\u2019s residence on Madison Avenue \u201cthe Powerhouse\u201d anymore. Mayors no longer consult regularly with the church about appointments to the health and Education Departments, police promotions or Family Court vacancies. Nor has any recent leader of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York been called \u201cthe American Pope,\u201d as one predecessor was. \n\n \n\n But while decades of demographic changes have cost the archdiocese much of its political clout, it does have the newly appointed  Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan  to its    credit . He is personable, persuasive and politically astute, and has an even bigger bully pulpit as president of the    United States Conference of Catholic Bishops , which has been battling the Obama administration, with some success, over whether religiously affiliated hospitals and universities should have to provide free    birth control  for employees. \n\n\n\n \n\n Cardinal Dolan recently told Catholics that with the church\u2019s fighting the government on several fronts, \u201cwe are called to be very active, very informed and very involved in politics.\u201d \n\n \n\n But will Catholics vote the church line? Does the archdiocese still wield power? \n\n\n\n"}, {"full_text_rss": 0, "media_id": 5546, "description": "<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/5926357450/in/photostream/\"><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif\" data-lazy-src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2012/09/0912-tweet-viz.png\" alt=\"See something or say something: Los Angeles\" width=\"320\" height=\"320\" style=\"float: right;margin: 5px 0 10px 15px\" /><noscript><img src=\"http://s.radar.oreilly.com/wp-files/2/2012/09/0912-tweet-viz.png\" alt=\"See something or say something: Los Angeles\" width=\"320\" height=\"320\" style=\"float: right;margin: 5px 0 10px 15px\" /></noscript></a>It&#8217;s not just a focus on data that connects the most recent class of <a href=\"http://strata.oreilly.com/2012/09/knight-news-challenge-data-winners.html\">Knight News Challenge winners</a>. They all are part of a distributed civic media community that works on open source code, collects and improves data, and collaborates across media organizations. </p>\r\n<p>These projects are &#8220;part of an infrastructure that helps journalists better understand and serve their communities through data,&#8221; commented Chris Sopher, Knight Foundation Journalism Program Associate, in <a href=\"http://strata.oreilly.com/2012/09/knight-news-challenge-data-winners.html\">an interview last week</a>. To apply a coding metaphor, the Knight Foundation is funding the creation of patches for the source code of society. This isn&#8217;t a new focus: in 2011, Knight chose to help build the <a href=\"http://strata.oreilly.com/2011/07/data-journalism-tools-newsroom-stack.html\">newsroom stack</a>, from editorial search engines to data cleaning tools. </p>\r\n<p>Following are four themes that jumped out when I looked across the <a href=\"http://strata.oreilly.com/2012/09/knight-news-challenge-data-winners.html\">winners of the latest Knight News Challenge round</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>Networked accountability</h2>\r\n<p>An intercontinental project that bridged citizen science, open data, open source hardware, civic hacking and the Internet of things to monitor, share and map radiation data? <a href=\"http://strata.oreilly.com/2012/09/knight-news-challenge-data-winners.html#safecast\">Safecast</a> is in its own category. Adapting the system to focus on air quality in Los Angeles &mdash; a city that&#8217;s known for its smog &mdash; will be an excellent stress test for seeing if this distributed approach to networked accountability can scale. </p>\r\n<p>If it does &mdash; and hacked Chumbys, LED signs, Twitter bots, smartphone apps and local media reports start featuring the results &mdash; open data is going to be baked into how residents of Los Angeles understand their own atmosphere. If this project delivers on some of its promise, the value of this approach will be clearer. </p>\r\n<p>If this project delivers on all of its potential, the air itself might improve. For that to happen, the people who are looking at the realities of air pollution will need to advocate for policy makers to improve it. In the future, the success or failure of this project will inform similar efforts that seek to enlist communities in data collection, including whether governments embrace &#8220;citizensourcing&#8221; beyond natural disasters and crises. The idea of citizens as sensors continues to have legs. <span id=\"more-53085\"></span></p>\r\n<h2>Peer-to-peer collaboration, across newsrooms</h2>\r\n<p>As long as I&#8217;ve been reading newspapers, watching television news and following the industry, competition has always been part of the dynamic: be first to the scene, first to get the scoop, first to call the election. As the Internet has taken on a larger role in delivering the news, there have been new opportunities for competition in digital journalism: first to tweet, post or upload video, often followed by rewards from online traffic. </p>\r\n<p>One (welcome) reality that jumps out in this series of Knight grants is that there are journalists from newsrooms that compete for stories who are collaborating on these projects independently. <a href=\"http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/09/new-york-times-washington-post-developers-team-up-to-create-open-elections-database/\">New York Times and Washington Post developers are teaming up</a> to create an <a href=\"http://strata.oreilly.com/2012/09/knight-news-challenge-data-winners.html#openelections\">open election database</a>. Data journalists from WNYC, the Chicago Tribune and the Spokesman-Review are collaborating on building a <a href=\"http://strata.oreilly.com/2012/09/knight-news-challenge-data-winners.html#censusIRE\">better interface for Census data</a>. The same <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444165804578008511493789642.html\">peer networks</a> that helped build the Internet are forming around building out civic infrastructure. It&#8217;s an inspiring trend to watch.</p>\r\n<h2>The value of an open geo commons</h2>\r\n<p>The amount of consternation regarding Apple&#8217;s new mapping app for iOS 6 doesn&#8217;t seem to be dying down. It shouldn&#8217;t: <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/27/technology/personaltech/apples-new-maps-app-is-upgraded-but-full-of-snags-review.html?pagewanted=all\">David Pogue called the Apple Map app</a> &#8220;an appalling first release,&#8221; and maybe &#8220;the most embarrassing, least usable piece of software Apple has ever unleashed.&#8221; It&#8217;s going to take a while for Apple Maps to improve &mdash; maybe even <a href=\"http://blog.telemapics.com/?p=399\">years</a>, based upon how long it took for Google to improve maps. In the meantime, iPhone users can go to <a href=\"http://maps.google.com\">maps.google.com</a> on Safari, along with the other third-party alternatives that Apple CEO Tim Cook recommended in his <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/letter-from-tim-cook-on-maps\">letter of apology</a>. </p>\r\n<p>In the wake of &#8220;#MAppleGate,&#8221; there&#8217;s suddenly a lot more attention being paid to the importance and value of mapping data, including how difficult it is to do maps right. And that&#8217;s where <a href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org\">OpenStreetMap</a> comes in. That&#8217;s also why the Knight Foundation is putting more than $500,000 behind tools from <a href=\"http://developmentseed.org/\">Development Seed</a>: it will help to sustain and improve an open geo data commons that media organizations large and small can tap into to inform communities using maps.</p>\r\n<p>&#8220;There are two ways the geo data space is going to evolve: 1) in closed silos of proprietary owned data or 2) in the open,&#8221; said Eric Gundersen, co-founder and CEO of Development Seed in <a href=\"http://strata.oreilly.com/2012/09/knight-news-challenge-data-winners.html\">a recent interview</a>. &#8220;Our community does not need a fleet of cars driving millions of miles. We need good infrastructure to make it easy for people to map their surroundings and good community tools to help us garden the data and improve quality. As geo data becomes core to mobile, maps are a canvas to visualizing the &#8216;where&#8217;.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>As with Wikipedia, there will be people who doubt whether an <a href=\"http://idealab.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/09/mapbox-aims-for-open-source-digital-map-revolution.php\">open source digital map revolution</a> enabled by <a href=\"http://mapbox.com\">MapBox</a>, Development Seed&#8217;s <a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/04/open-source-mapping-node.html\">open source mapping suite</a> will come to pass. Then again, how many people believed a decade ago that Wikipedia would grow into the knowledge repository it is today?</p>\r\n<p>&#8220;We are trying to radically lower the barrier of entry to map making for organizations and activists,&#8221; <a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/04/open-source-mapping-node.html\">Gundersen told me</a> last April. Given that they&#8217;re up against Google in mapmaking, the relatively tiny DC startup is banking on OpenStreetMap looking more like Wikipedia than Google Knol in a few years. </p>\r\n<h2>&#8220;Open&#8221; is in</h2>\r\n<p>Open data is a <a href=\"http://strata.oreilly.com/2012/09/knight-news-challenge-data-winners.html\">common thread that connects the winners</a> &mdash; but the openness doesn&#8217;t stop there. Open maps. Open source. Open government. <a href=\"http://storify.com/digiphile/what-is-open-journalism\">Open journalism</a>. That this theme has emerged as a strong pulse isn&#8217;t a tremendous surprise, given a global movement to apply technology to open government. Moreover, no one should take this to mean that immense amounts of business, society, technology, media and government aren&#8217;t still closed. <a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/blog/tag/government-secrecy\">Clearly</a>, that&#8217;s not the situation. But there&#8217;s a strong case to be made that <a href=\"http://davidsasaki.name/2012/09/dispatch-open-knowledge-festival/\">open is the way of the day</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Data won&#8217;t save the world, on its own. However, when <a href=\"http://strata.oreilly.com/2012/02/data-public-good.html\">data is applied for the public good</a> and put to work, there are a growing number of examples that raise optimism about data&#8217;s role in the future of journalism.</p>\r\n<p><em>Photo Credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/5926357450/in/photostream/\">Eric Fisher</a></em></p>\r\n<div

communities through data,\u201d commented Chris Sopher, Knight Foundation Journalism Program Associate, in  an interview last week . To apply a coding metaphor, the Knight Foundation is funding the creation of patches for the source code of society. This isn\u2019t a new focus: in 2011, Knight chose to help build the  newsroom stack , from editorial search engines to data cleaning tools.  \n\n\n\n \n\n An intercontinental project that bridged citizen science, open data, open source hardware, civic hacking and the Internet of things to monitor, share and map radiation data?  Safecast  is in its own category. Adapting the system to focus on air quality in Los Angeles \u2014 a city that\u2019s known for its smog \u2014 will be an excellent stress test for seeing if this distributed approach to networked accountability can scale.  \n\n \n\n If it does \u2014 and hacked Chumbys, LED signs, Twitter bots, smartphone apps and local media reports start featuring the results \u2014 open data is going to be baked into how residents of Los Angeles understand their own atmosphere. If this project delivers on some of its promise, the value of this approach will be clearer.  \n\n \n\n If this project delivers on all of its potential, the air itself might improve. For that to happen, the people who are looking at the realities of air pollution will need to advocate for policy makers to improve it. In the future, the success or failure of this project will inform similar efforts that seek to enlist communities in data collection, including whether governments embrace \u201ccitizensourcing\u201d beyond natural disasters and crises. The idea of citizens as sensors continues to have legs.    \n\n \n\n Peer-to-peer collaboration, across newsrooms \n\n \n\n As long as I\u2019ve been reading newspapers, watching television news and following the industry, competition has always been part of the dynamic: be first to the scene, first to get the scoop, first to call the election. As the Internet has taken on a larger role in delivering the news, there have been new opportunities for competition in digital journalism: first to tweet, post or upload video, often followed by rewards from online traffic.  \n\n \n\n One (welcome) reality that jumps out in this series of Knight grants is that there are journalists from newsrooms that compete for stories who are collaborating on these projects independently.  New York Times and Washington Post developers are teaming up  to create an  open election database . Data journalists from WNYC, the Chicago Tribune and the Spokesman-Review are collaborating on building a  better interface for Census data . The same  peer networks  that helped build the Internet are forming around building out civic infrastructure. It\u2019s an inspiring trend to watch. \n\n\n\n \n\n The amount of consternation regarding Apple\u2019s new mapping app for iOS 6 doesn\u2019t seem to be dying down. It shouldn\u2019t:  David Pogue called the Apple Map app  \u201can appalling first release,\u201d and maybe \u201cthe most embarrassing, least usable piece of software Apple has ever unleashed.\u201d It\u2019s going to take a while for Apple Maps to improve \u2014 maybe even  years , based upon how long it took for Google to improve maps. In the meantime, iPhone users can go to  maps.google.com  on Safari, along with the other third-party alternatives that Apple CEO Tim Cook recommended in his  letter of apology .  \n\n \n\n In the wake of \u201c#MAppleGate,\u201d there\u2019s suddenly a lot more attention being paid to the importance and value of mapping data, including how difficult it is to do maps right. And that\u2019s where  OpenStreetMap  comes in. That\u2019s also why the Knight Foundation is putting more than $500,000 behind tools from  Development Seed : it will help to sustain and improve an open geo data commons that media organizations large and small can tap into to inform communities using maps. \n\n \n\n \u201cThere are two ways the geo data space is going to evolve: 1) in closed silos of proprietary owned data or 2) in the open,\u201d said Eric Gundersen, co-founder and CEO of Development Seed in  a recent interview . \u201cOur community does not need a fleet of cars driving millions of miles. We need good infrastructure to make it easy for people to map their surroundings and good community tools to help us garden the data and improve quality. As geo data becomes core to mobile, maps are a canvas to visualizing the \u2018where\u2019.\u201d \n\n \n\n As with Wikipedia, there will be people who doubt whether an  open source digital map revolution  enabled by  MapBox , Development Seed\u2019s  open source mapping suite  will come to pass. Then again, how many people believed a decade ago that Wikipedia would grow into the knowledge repository it is today? \n\n \n\n \u201cWe are trying to radically lower the barrier of entry to map making for organizations and activists,\u201d  Gundersen told me  last April.

Open maps. Open source. Open government.  Open journalism . That this theme has emerged as a strong pulse isn\u2019t a tremendous surprise, given a global movement to apply technology to open government. Moreover, no one should take this to mean that immense amounts of business, society, technology, media and government aren\u2019t still closed.  Clearly , that\u2019s not the situation.

As the Internet has taken on a larger role in delivering the news, there have been new opportunities for competition in digital journalism: first to tweet, post or upload video, often followed by rewards from online traffic. \n\n\n\n"}, {"full_text_rss": 0, "media_id": 6798, "description": "<p><a href=\"http://wnymedia.net/2012/11/a-mayor-with-innovation-goals/innovative-business-ideas/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-188196\"><img class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-188196\" src=\"http://wnymedia.net/wp-content/uploads//innovative-business-ideas-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a></p>\n<p>San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee has made innovation a focus of his new administration.

Part of a growing initiative to increase government transparency and civic engagement, the group explains that:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The event will bring together citizens, software developers, and entrepreneurs from all over the nation to collaboratively create, build, and invent new solutions using publicly-released data, code and technology to solve challenges relevant to our neighborhoods, our cities, our states and our country. National Day of Civic Hacking will provide citizens an opportunity to do what is most quintessentially American: roll up our sleeves, get involved and work together to improve our society.</p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Participants could create apps that visualize government data sets or combine them across agencies. For example, Census and Department Of Labor data could be mashed up to examine what demographic and industry factors combine to reduce unemployment.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, while a ton of government data has become &#8220;publicly available&#8221; over the past few years, much of it isn&#8217;t truly accessible because it lacks strong APIs or user interfaces. Hackers could build these to lay the groundwork for future innovation with public data.</p>\n<p>Dror Berman, Managing Partner of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://innovationendeavors.com/\">Innovation Endeavors</a> tells me the simultaneous nationwide event\u00a0&#8221;is a collaboration party for America, with technology at the heart.&#8221; There are several ways you can join this civic engagement party (it will be more fun than that sounds).</p>\n<p>You can <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hackforchange.org/signup.html\">plan an event in your city</a> or support a local event by becoming a host.

They were all cases where the individuals involved may have done things that some would think <i>inconsiderate</i>, but that hardly should rise to the level of \"criminal\" behavior -- especially with threats of many years in jail.  Presenting the flipside to that argument: the editorialists at the Toronto Globe and Mail, who show why those who don't understand technology have no business writing about it.  The editorial is headlined <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/editorials/when-did-it-become-wrong-to-punish-hackers/article7654240/\" target=\"_blank\">When did it become wrong to punish hackers?</a>, which already suggests problem number one.  Hacker is a generic term that does not automatically imply malicious attacks, yet the Globe and Mail immediately seems to assume otherwise.  That might be news to the US government, which just announced its own <a href=\"http://hackforchange.org/\" target=\"_blank\">National Day for Civic Hacking</a> (despite filing charges against such civic hackers...).\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nA Montreal school is being widely criticized for expelling a student who hacked into its computer system and helped expose flaws in the system&#8217;s security. The student now has been offered jobs by computer security companies, including the one that ran the system he hacked into. In the Internet age, the hacker is celebrated as a hero and the school is pilloried for being an overbearing, defensive holdover from a bygone age. It&#8217;s an unfair presumption that needs to be corrected.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nThat's one version of the story.  The hacker is celebrated as a hero because he did something useful: exposed a security flaw that could have been used by someone malicious for nefarious purposes.  We generally want to celebrate those who spot danger and warn people away from it.  And the school is being pilloried because it expelled this person.  Without Ahmed Al-Khabaz's help, the data of students would be at risk.  Doesn't it seem somewhat overbearing to blame the messenger?  What exactly is \"unfair\" about the presumption?  After pointing out that Al-Khabaz \"discovered a serious flaw\" the editorial still supports his expulsion, apparently entirely based on the fact that the company, Skytech, felt his probing was an attack:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n... Mr. Al-Khabaz then went on and carried out what the company considered to be a &#8220;cyber-attack&#8221; on the school&#8217;s production servers. The company notified the school, and Mr. Al-Khabaz was hauled on the carpet. The company accepted the student&#8217;s explanation and noted that he &#8220;demonstrated great talent in computer science.&#8221; They dropped the matter and offered Mr. Al-Khabaz a job, but Dawson&#8217;s administrators felt the student had gone too far and expelled him on the grounds he had violated the college&#8217;s code of conduct.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nWhat the company considered a \"cyber-attack\" could also be described as \"checking to see if the flaw was fixed.\"  And, clearly, they didn't think it was a huge problem if they offered him a job, and noted his \"great talent.\"  So why does the school still think he went too far?\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\n Dawson&#8217;s officials are right: Rules exist for a reason, and students cannot expect to break them without consequence. Why have them, otherwise?\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nAhhhhhh.  Rules are rules. Rules exist for reasons, but sometimes those reasons are bad.  And punishing people for breaking rules in ways that help people seems like sending the exact wrong message.  Sometimes rules should be broken, because the rules are wrong.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe editorial then moves on to Aaron Swartz:\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nSwartz, who had a history of depression, was facing a slew of charges for allegedly downloading publicly funded academic journals from a large database that charged a fee for access. His family and supporters blame overzealous prosecutors for his death; the prosecutors insist &#8211; again, quite rightly &#8211; that &#8220;stealing is stealing.&#8221;\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nUh, \"stealing is stealing\" is a tautology, so of course it's right.  But what's \"wrong\" is arguing that what Swartz did was \"stealing.\"  He stole nothing.  He downloaded papers from MIT's <i>open</i> network, which was set up with a site license from JSTOR allowing <i>open</i> downloading of those journal articles, all of which remained on the site for anyone else to download.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nGo ahead, explain what was \"stolen\"?\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nIn the age of the Internet, the massive downloading for free of music and movies and other copyrighted material has muddied the waters for many people.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nIt seems to have \"muddied the waters\" for the editorial writers of the Toronto Globe and Mail who don't seem to realize that neither case had anything to do with the \"massive downloading for free of music and movies.\"\r\n<blockquote><i>\r\nThey seem to have forgotten that privacy rights and copyright laws are among the foundations of our economy. These are things that are not to be shoved aside by the absolutism of Internet activism.\r\n</i></blockquote>\r\nOh really?  If privacy rights are the foundation of the economy, then, er, isn't it a <i>good thing</i> that Al-Khabaz alerted officials to a hole that <b>exposed</b> the private info of students.  He did nothing to compromise anyone's privacy rights at all.  Similarly, Aaron Swartz did not violate any copyright law, and he was not charged with copyright law violations.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSo, seriously, how does a huge mainstream publication like the Globe and Mail get away with writing a piece of garbage this ridiculous?  It claims things that simply aren't true, completely flips around reality, and then seems to wrap it up in some bizarre \"rules are rules\" arguming, that makes no sense since the rules it says people violated... weren't even violated.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAnd the Globe and Mail thinks people should <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/the-globe-to-roll-out-metered-paywall-as-industry-shifts-to-digital-revenue/article4612259/\">pay its meter</a> to access this kind of crap?<br

Nearly Every Detail \n\n\n\n from the  apparently-never  dept \n\n\n\n We just recently wrote about a trio of recent situations -- all involving young hackers probing for information, leading to either criminal charges or threats of criminal charges against them -- that show what happens when people in power  don't understand  how technology works.  They were all cases where the individuals involved may have done things that some would think  inconsiderate , but that hardly should rise to the level of \"criminal\" behavior -- especially with threats of many years in jail.  Presenting the flipside to that argument: the editorialists at the Toronto Globe and Mail, who show why those who don't understand technology have no business writing about it.  The editorial is headlined  When did it become wrong to punish hackers? , which already suggests problem number one.  Hacker is a generic term that does not automatically imply malicious attacks, yet the Globe and Mail immediately seems to assume otherwise.  That might be news to the US government, which just announced its own  National Day for Civic Hacking  (despite filing charges against such civic hackers...).\n\n A Montreal school is being widely criticized for expelling a student who hacked into its computer system and helped expose flaws in the system\u2019s security. The student now has been offered jobs by computer security companies, including the one that ran the system he hacked into. In the Internet age, the hacker is celebrated as a hero and the school is pilloried for being an overbearing, defensive holdover from a bygone age. It\u2019s an unfair presumption that needs to be corrected.\n\n That's one version of the story.  The hacker is celebrated as a hero because he did something useful: exposed a security flaw that could have been used by someone malicious for nefarious purposes.  We generally want to celebrate those who spot danger and warn people away from it.  And the school is being pilloried because it expelled this person.  Without Ahmed Al-Khabaz's help, the data of students would be at risk.  Doesn't it seem somewhat overbearing to blame the messenger?  What exactly is \"unfair\" about the presumption?  After pointing out that Al-Khabaz \"discovered a serious flaw\" the editorial still supports his expulsion, apparently entirely based on the fact that the company, Skytech, felt his probing was an attack:\n\n ... Mr. Al-Khabaz then went on and carried out what the company considered to be a \u201ccyber-attack\u201d on the school\u2019s production servers. The company notified the school, and Mr. Al-Khabaz was hauled on the carpet. The company accepted the student\u2019s explanation and noted that he \u201cdemonstrated great talent in computer science.\u201d They dropped the matter and offered Mr. Al-Khabaz a job, but Dawson\u2019s administrators felt the student had gone too far and expelled him on the grounds he had violated the college\u2019s code of conduct.\n\n What the company considered a \"cyber-attack\" could also be described as \"checking to see if the flaw was fixed.\"  And, clearly, they didn't think it was a huge problem if they offered him a job, and noted his \"great talent.\"  So why does the school still think he went too far?\n\n  Dawson\u2019s officials are right: Rules exist for a reason, and students cannot expect to break them without consequence. Why have them, otherwise?\n\n Ahhhhhh.  Rules are rules. Rules exist for reasons, but sometimes those reasons are bad.  And punishing people for breaking rules in ways that help people seems like sending the exact wrong message.  Sometimes rules should be broken, because the rules are wrong. The editorial then moves on to Aaron Swartz:\n\n Swartz, who had a history of depression, was facing a slew of charges for allegedly downloading publicly funded academic journals from a large database that charged a fee for access. His family and supporters blame overzealous prosecutors for his death; the prosecutors insist \u2013 again, quite rightly \u2013 that \u201cstealing is stealing.\u201d\n\n Uh, \"stealing is stealing\" is a tautology, so of course it's right.  But what's \"wrong\" is arguing that what Swartz did was \"stealing.\"  He stole nothing.  He downloaded papers from MIT's  open  network, which was set up with a site license from JSTOR allowing  open  downloading of those journal articles, all of which remained on the site for anyone else to download. Go ahead, explain what was \"stolen\"?\n\n It seems to have \"muddied the waters\" for the editorial writers of the Toronto Globe and Mail who don't seem to realize that neither case had anything to do with the \"massive downloading for free of music and movies.\"\n\n They seem to have forgotten that privacy rights and copyright laws are among the foundations of our economy. These are things that are not to be shoved aside by the absolutism of Internet activism.\n\n So, seriously, how does a huge mainstream publication like the Globe and Mail get away with writing a piece of garbage this ridiculous?  It claims things that simply aren't true, completely flips around reality, and then seems to wrap it up in some bizarre \"rules are rules\" arguming, that makes no sense since the rules it says people violated... weren't even violated.\n\n \n\n Explore some core concepts: \n\n\n\n"}, {"full_text_rss": 0, "media_id": 1149, "description": "<p><a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/technolog/white-house-petition-site-getting-revamp-1B8271013\"><img align=\"left\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Photo/_new/1b5898315-wtp.thumb.jpg\" alt=\"We The People, the White House's official online petition platform, will be getting a big update in the coming months.

class=\"entry-summary\">Along with a look at loads of new hardware like 3-D printers and motion-sensing computer interfaces, 2013's South by Southwest Interactive put a focus on technology as a driver of social movements good and bad.\n\nThe estimated 27,000 attendees of the annual five-day event, an outgrowth of the SXSW music and film festivals, were offered sessions on how government and hackers are joining forces, the role of social media in fostering free speech, and a warning from former Vice President Al Gore about some of the darker aspects of the rise of tech in everyday life.\n\nThe civic hacking movement's increasing visibility is driven partly by the growing connectedness between people and their government, said Alexander Howard, a reporter who covers government and transparency for O'Reilly Media in Washington, D.C.\n\nCivic hacking also has found itself in legally questionable territory at times, Howard said, highlighting the recent suicide of Internet activist Aaron Swartz, who was facing an investigation into charges he stole data from a computer network at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nSix Drivers of Global Change, which argues that the planet is being abused, technology is amiss and special-interest groups have control of the government.\n\nIn a wide-ranging discussion, Gore touched on robo-sourcing, which is the replacement of human workers with machines, 3-D printing, cloning and genetic engineering.\n\nNear the end of the session, Mossberg turned to Gore's decision to sell Current TV to cable news network Al Jazeera for $500 million.\n\nMusk termed the Times' recent stinging review of his electric automobile company's Model S sedan - the facts of which he and the paper have publicly debated - a low-grade ethics violation.\n\n\"Texas is the leading candidate, but we need certain legislation to pass that's supportive of space launch,\" Musk said, including provisions that would allow authorities to close the beach near the spaceport during a launch and protections from what he described as nuisance lawsuits.</div></div><br clear=\"both\" style=\"clear: both;\"/>\n<br clear=\"both\" style=\"clear:

Their aim: transforming reams of government data into Web applications that help citizens access government services. \n\n\n\n The civic hacking movement's increasing visibility is driven partly by the growing connectedness between people and their government, said  Alexander Howard , a reporter who covers government and transparency for  O'Reilly Media  in Washington, D.C.  \n\n\n\n \"There is a really interesting group of people in the United States and around the world who do social coding now,\" he said. \"The most interesting stuff is not what they do on Twitter, it's what they do on GitHub\" - a website that allows people to easily share the code they write. \n\n\n\n Programmers in the movement haven't shied away from describing themselves as hackers, despite the word's baggage.  \n\n\n\n Among the successful \"hacks\" discussed:  \n\n\n\n -- An app built for Chicago that tracked where someone could get a flu shot.  \n\n\n\n -- Austin hackers built an app to help voters find their polling places.  \n\n\n\n -- In New Orleans, hackers helped clean up city data on blighted homes and built an app that helped put the data to work. \n\n\n\n The movement has grown dramatically over the last several years, spurred on by an increasing acceptance, helped by organized efforts like Code for America, and the growing availability of government data.  \n\n\n\n The  Obama  administration has launched its Open Government Initiative to make federal data more accessible to the public. It held its first official \"hackathon\" in February, inviting programmers from around the country to work alongside members of its development team.  \n\n\n\n Civic hacking also has found itself in legally questionable territory at times, Howard said, highlighting the recent suicide of Internet activist  Aaron Swartz , who was facing an investigation into charges he stole data from a computer network at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \n\n\n\n  YouTube revolution:  Dr.  Bassem Youssef 's journey to becoming the \" Jon Stewart  of Egypt\" began eight weeks after Egyptian dictator  Hosni Mubarak  fell from power. \n\n\n\n Youssef, a surgeon, filmed the first episode of his political satire program in his laundry room and uploaded it to YouTube in March 2011.  \n\n\n\n Less than two months and seven videos later, the show had recorded 5 million views. Its success got him a show on television that would go on to become one of the most watched programs in Egypt. \n\n\n\n \"Political satire was absolutely nonexistent\" before the revolution, Youssef said Saturday.  \n\n\n\n His success is one of the most prominent examples of how social media services like YouTube, Facebook (he has 3.5 million fans) and Twitter (where nearly 1.8 million follow him) are helping to change ideas about speech and politics in a part of the world known for dictatorships that repress both. \n\n\n\n The program's ratings and subject matter have made him one of the most prominent advocates of free speech in the Arab world. His show has come under pressure, however, from the government and some religious regional leaders because it mocks Egypt's  Muslim Brotherhood -backed president and takes on ultraconservative Islamic clerics.  \n\n\n\n \"Freedom of speech in Egypt will stay alive as long as we don't shut up,\" Youssef said. \"Freedom of speech cannot be constricted by laws; it will be constricted by you censoring yourself.\" \n\n\n\n  Gore remains optimistic:  For former Vice President Al Gore, the world is spinning out of control - but he says his outlook remains optimistic. \n\n\n\n He came to SXSW Interactive to discuss his latest book, \"The Future: Six Drivers of Global Change,\" which argues that the planet is being abused, technology is amiss and special-interest groups have control of the government. \n\n\n\n \"The book is scary,\" said  Wall Street Journal  technology columnist  Walter Mossberg , who moderated the session. \n\n\n\n In a wide-ranging discussion, Gore touched on robo-sourcing, which is the replacement of human workers with machines, 3-D printing, cloning and genetic engineering. \n\n\n\n He also took aim at the political scene in Washington, arguing that the United States is losing its leadership position in the world and that U.S. democracy had been \"hacked\" by special interests. \n\n\n\n Near the end of the session, Mossberg turned to Gore's decision to sell Current TV to cable news network Al Jazeera for $500 million. Gore co-founded the cable network. \n\n\n\n Mossberg asked Gore how he could argue for independence from foreign oil in the U.S., but sell the company to a news outlet owned by Qatar, a major oil producer. Gore, in turn, asked how Mossberg could continue working for  Rupert Murdoch , whose News Corp. acquired the Wall Street Journal in 2007. \n\n\n\n Murdoch isn't in the oil business, Mossberg said. With a chuckle, Gore shot back that Murdoch isn't in the news business, either.  \n\n\n\n  Musk's still mad:   Tesla Motors  chief  Elon Musk  continued his feud with the  New York Times  and criticized the U.S. government for abandoning space exploration in a presentation Saturday. \n\n\n\n Musk termed the Times' recent stinging review of his electric automobile company's Model S sedan - the facts of which he and the paper have publicly debated - a \"low-grade ethics violation.\" \"I don't have a problem with critical reviews,\" Musk told the audience, \"I have a problem with false reviews.\" \n\n\n\n Musk also spoke about plans for another of his ventures, SpaceX, to build a space port in South Texas, an idea that he testified about in front of the  Texas House Appropriations Committee  on Friday. \n\n\n\n \"Texas is the leading candidate, but we need certain legislation to pass that's supportive of space launch,\" Musk said, including provisions that would allow authorities to close the beach near the spaceport during a launch and protections from what he described as nuisance lawsuits. \n\n\n\n He disputed the notion that his firm is competing with NASA, which he said is his space venture's largest customer. Instead, he said that he started SpaceX as part of an effort to get Congress to increase NASA's funding so it could afford to send man to Mars. \"We lost the will to explore and lost the will to push the boundary,\" Musk said.  \n\n\n\n Noland Hicks and Valentino Lucio are San Antonio News-Express staff writers.

Leaders in local governments want to innovate. The Code for America Fellowship brings these two groups together for a structured year of building apps, piloting user-centered design and lean startup techniques. \n\n           \n\n The success of the Fellowship is measured not in lines of code, but in sustainable, meaningful change. It's about proving that government can move at the speed of citizens, can speak the language of citizens, and can cost what citizens are willing to pay. \n\n\n\n             \n\n Creating simplified interfaces to the public school system. \n\n\n\n             \n\n Helping citizens to organize and take action in their community. \n\n\n\n             \n\n Organizing and promoting neighborhood and community group information. \n\n\n\n             \n\n Creating a commons for civic software information exchange. \n\n\n\n             \n\n Preparing residents for the whims of mother nature. \n\n\n\n             \n\n Experimenting with different methods of viewing, tracking, and analyzing 311 requests. \n\n\n\n             \n\n Creating tools to support the work of community groups and associations, and providing more residents with access to transit information. \n\n\n\n             \n\n Creating a citizen-centric interface to the City that\u2019s written by the residents for the residents. \n\n\n\n             \n\n Making it easy to create data visualizations and find transit routes. \n\n\n\n             \n\n Helping residents understand the status of blighted and abandoned properties. \n\n\n\n             \n\n Bridging the digital divide and bringing more representative feedback to city planning. \n\n\n\n             \n\n Finding new ways to tackle economic development and encourage new businesses to set up shop in town. \n\n\n\n                 \n\n Amir Reavis-Bey spent more than seven years working as an investment banking technologist in New York City, developing an expertise in systems integration. As a Fellow he helped the City of New Orleans address the chronic issue of blighted and abandoned properties. At the end of their Fellowship year, Amir and the New Orleans team founded a company to offer  BlightStatus  to other cities. As co-founder of  Civic Industries , he\u2019s now part of a new wave of technology startups that are helping government provide higher value to citizens at a far lower cost. \n\n\n\n                 \n\n Ruthie BenDor is a front-end developer and designer who worked for GLAD and MassEquality and founded a 100+ member user group for the ExpressionEngine CMS. As a Fellow, Ruthie and the Santa Cruz, Calif. team collaborated closely with Economic Development Coordinator Peter Koht to make it easier for entrepreneurs to start local businesses. The resulting tool,  OpenCounter , walks an aspiring small business owner through the complicated zoning codes, forms, and fees needed to apply for a business permit \u2013 and enables them to apply directly online. Ruthie's now a design technologist at fuseproject. \n\n\n\n                 \n\n Jesse Bounds is a software engineer with a decade of experience, including leading the development of Fluent, the first highly optimized news aggregator and reader for the iPhone. As a Fellow on the Chicago team, he built tools to help cities make service requests \u2013 like broken streetlights or potholes \u2013 easier to manage and understand. Now Chicagoans can go to  311 ServiceTracker  and see the status of their requests throughout the process, as easily as they track packages through FedEx. He is now an engineer at Pivotal Labs in San Francisco. \n\n\n\n                 \n\n Sheba Najmi was a lead designer for Yahoo!Mail (260+ million users), co-founded a startup, and was a television news anchor in Pakistan. She holds MS and BS degrees in Symbolic Systems from Stanford University. As a Fellow, she combined website analytics data, community participation, and great design to create a new interface to Honololu government that is truly simple, beautiful, and easy to use:  Honolulu Answers . She's now an instructor at Girl Develop It. \n\n\n\n           \n\n Citizen input is essential to the healthy functioning of any democracy, but the Philadelphia City Planning Commission lamented that many residents couldn\u2019t make it to the few in-person meetings the agency could afford to hold, and that those who did often represented only vocal minorities. \n\n         \n\n The Fellows learned that only 60% of Philadelphia residents have broadband internet at home, but more than 90% have access to mobile phones with text messaging. So the team designed, built, and deployed  Textizen , which uses posters and bus shelter ads to solicit hyper-local feedback via SMS. It allows the city to create targeted surveys and collect responses via text message so that traditionally under-represented groups can participate. Other cities have taken note, and now the Fellows are starting a company to meet the demand. So far they've collected more than 14,000 responses on more than 30 surveys, and are working with cities like Boston and Salt Lake City. \n\n\n\n           \n\n CfA\u2019s Honolulu team faced a near-impossible challenge. Nearly everyone they interviewed, inside City Hall as well as outside, wanted a better city website. But with tens of thousands of pages of content owned by dozens of departments, the project was out of scope for a team of three in under a year. Undeterred, the Fellows mined the search logs of Honolulu.gov to find the most common searches, and then tried those top searches in live user testing with residents. \n\n           \n\n They found that on the existing site people were unable to easily find the answers to basic questions, such as how to get and renew a driver's license. So the team built a simple, beautiful, easy-to-use interface they called  Honolulu Answers , and wrote clear, plain language answers to a few of the most frequently asked questions.  \n\n           \n\n Then they tapped the power of the community to help the project grow. Early on a Saturday in July, more than 55 Honolulu residents came together to write answers to dozens more of their top questions. At what may have been the first ever civic \u201cwrite-a-thon,\u201d this group not only created an invaluable public tool, they also created a community that is taking responsibility for their own access to government information and continues to maintain Honolulu Answers. \n\n\n\n             \n\n Chicago's 311 call center receives nearly four million calls each year, and nearly 40% of these calls are from residents checking on the status of an earlier service request.  \n\n             \n\n The Fellows tackled this problem head on, building  311 Service Tracker , a FedEx like view of every service request submitted to the city. Service Tracker shows all the actions on a given request, across every department involved, in one streamlined interface to enable citizens to view the status of their complaint.  \n\n             \n\n Chicago residents can submit 311 requests by phone or online, and receive real-time notifications via email when their service request is complete. The app reduces citizen wait times and redundancies in the system while increasing transparency and responsiveness.  \n\n\n\n             \n\n Real civic innovation requires engaged communities, a healthy marketplace, and a collaborative network for government innovators. \n\n             \n\n So in 2012, Code for America not only expanded from three Fellowship cities to eight. \n\n\n\n             \n\n In times of shrinking budgets and higher demands on government, it is essential to find new ways for local government to operate. Citizens are showing they can take on more responsibility and governments are seeing the community as capacity to help with things such as digging out fire hydrants in the snow, helping shape city plans and designs, and even rewriting government websites. \n\n             \n\n The  Code for America Brigade  provides a national platform to help these groups come together, and for others, the tools and resources to start a local chapter in their community. This growing network of civic leaders is working to redefine the notion of citizenship at the local level. \n\n\n\n                     \n\n As Brigade Captain, Christopher teaches a weekly class on civic hacking at Chicago's Open Gov Hack Nights. When not at Hack Night or reporting on the state of civic hacking in Chicago, Christopher works at Smart Chicago Collaborative on projects like the Chicago User Testing Group, which ensures that the apps being developed by civic hackers are useful to the everyday Chicagoan. Christopher has a master's in public administration from DePaul University and is a veteran of the Iraq War. \n\n\n\n                     \n\n Jeffrey Johnson got his start with civic hacking two years ago, standing up tools that make county GIS data easier to access. Now as the San Diego Brigade Captain, he hosts weekly events and serves as a public advocate for open government, appearing before the city council and other regional governments. Jeffrey is a software developer with OpenGeo, where he's on the GeoNode team, and lives in San Diego with his young family. \n\n\n\n                     \n\n CfA challenged Brigades and civic hackers everywhere to deploy one of four open-source civic apps by Election Day through a national competition called \"The Race for Reuse.\" The results were astounding: 31 civic apps in 28 cities. The winning effort was the redeployment of Adopt-a-Hydrant in Anchorage, Alaska. With the support of Anchorage CIO Lance Ahern (far right), volunteer Becky Boone (middle) led the effort, recruiting citizens to agree to dig out their adopted hydrants when they\u2019re covered in snow. By year's end, 191 of the fire hydrants in Anchorage were adopted by residents. \n\n\n\n             \n\n The past few decades have seen lightweight web and mobile technology change the world, but the public sector remains saddled with software that is overly-complex, increasingly expensive, and often broken. And with local governments in fiscal crisis, these outdated systems are breaking the bank. \n\n             \n\n But there\u2019s a new wave of tech companies who assume that good technology is as easy to use as an iPad \u2014 and that you get more for your dollar every year, not less. The  Code for America Accelerator  finds the most innovative, relevant civic startups building tools for government, and provides them business consulting and mentorship, a broad network of potential investors and customers, and a national platform to raise awareness. \n\n\n\n                     \n\n The companies participating in the Accelerator are building businesses by offering governments new technologies that save time and money \u2014 and also help them connect with citizens in new ways. The program amplified their reach with mentorship from key players in the tech industry, $25k in seed funding, and the opportunity to share their products with governments nationwide. \n\n                     \n\n These are not just thriving companies, but people with incredible entrepreneurial energy and passion. \n\n\n\n                 \n\n \u201cGiven heightened attention to government spending, there\u2019s not only the need, but an urgency to engage with new, disruptive startups.\u201d \n\n\n\n                                 \n\n Find food, health, housing and employment programs in seconds. \n\n                                 \n\n Aunt Bertha picks up where Uncle Sam left off by simplifying the search and application process for government programs. Aunt Bertha collects information on federal, state, county, city, neighborhood and nonprofit programs and puts it all in one place. In just a few seconds, users can enter basic information and find programs relevant to their needs. \n\n\n\n                                 \n\n The best way to turn paper forms into digital data. \n\n                                 \n\n Captricity is an award-winning Berkeley, Calif.-based technology startup that offers a completely self-serve data entry service for digitizing paper forms. Captricity can get data off of paper and into a digital spreadsheet quickly and cheaply. It provides human-quality data entry that even works on hand-writing -- but at a fraction of what manual data entry costs. \n\n\n\n                                 \n\n LearnSprout brings interoperability and accessibility to school data. LearnSprout builds tools to access valuable data (e.g. roster info, grades, attendance) currently siloed away in legacy student information systems. It\u2019s creating a web API service that allows developers to build classroom apps to leverage this data, without the expensive enterprise-like vendor integration process. \n\n\n\n                                 \n\n Manage and Measure Your Social Media Outreach. \n\n                                 \n\n Measured Voice is a web-based social media management system (SMMS) designed to help government organizations create, publish, and measure social media content. Measured Voice helps users manage multiple social media accounts, enact publishing workflow, delineate team roles, and measure results and team performance through a simple interface. \n\n\n\n                                 \n\n Identify and build a community of active contributors. \n\n                                 \n\n MindMixer is an engagement tool that activates community contributors. Ideas, voices, and perspectives are shared by the community and help to facilitate deeper conversations that yield actionable insights. The tool has helped create a network of contributors in more than 250 organizations around the country. \n\n\n\n                                 \n\n Help towns organize disaster recovery with mobile and web-based technology. \n\n                                 \n\n Recovers is building a toolkit for community powered disaster recovery. Recovers disaster response platform incorporates searchable databases, social media aggregation, and mobile tools, allowing grassroots organizers to efficiently marshal resources in their area.  Recovers provides vital infrastructure to a devastated area, even if internet is knocked out for a week. \n\n\n\n                                 \n\n Measure and understand how local governments perform. \n\n                                 \n\n Revelstone is a performance metrics and social networking company for the public sector. Revelstone is building an online virtual community that enables local government leaders to measure, compare and discuss operational performance results with their peers in order to learn from each other to improve. \n\n\n\n             \n\n Local governments are changing. Forward-thinking public servants across the country are leveraging technology to innovate the way our cities work \u2014 and it\u2019s accelerated by the exchange of ideas, solutions, best practices, and even software code between like-minded leaders. Cities are now appointing Chief Data Officers and Chief Innovation Officers; they are redeploying each other\u2019s apps; and they are working together to take on common policy challenges. This new network of civic leaders is showing that real change is possible from inside city hall. \n\n             \n\n  The  Code for America Peer Network  is a professional network for local government innovators who share the common goal of taking innovation in their city to the next level. Through the Peer Network, Code for America connects local governments around the country to facilitate collaborative problem-solving, peer learning, and the spread of innovation best practices between cities. \n\n\n\n                 \n\n \u201cI get a thrill out of solving problems \u2014 that's what attracted me to public service.\u201d \n\n\n\n                 \n\n \u201cIt's not just the creation of a bunch of apps. It's connecting our citizens with our city.\u201d \n\n\n\n                 \n\n \u201cThis has been one of the most incredible experiences in my professional career.\u201d \n\n\n\n                 \n\n \u201cI think making these relationships at the Code for America Summit carries you through the year, and really leads you to try to be a better civic employee.\u201d \n\n\n\n       \n\n In 2012, Code for America went from being an interesting experiment to a proven engine of change. The organization made this transition because of thousands of people like you. You proved that officials at all levels of government are eager for a new playbook, and that some of the brightest talents in technology and design are eager to collaborate with them on it. You proved that interfaces to government can be simple, beautiful, and easy to use, and that they need not cost more than citizens are willing to pay. You proved that where governments lack capacity, the community can be that capacity. You proved that government can work for the people, by the people, in the 21st century. \n\n \n\n       \n\n The two questions I am asked most often are \u201cwhat can I do to help?\u201d and \u201chow will Code for America scale?\u201d They are the same question. We will scale the way any successful network scales, with some basic protocols and a common purpose to bind us, and the creativity and hard work of every person who finds us and cares enough to make a difference. The movement scales when everyone who believes that government is something that we do together finds a way to contribute, in his or her own way. There are a hundred ways to make a difference, from  writing code  to  unclogging a storm drain  in Oakland, Calif., where I live. It's time to  get involved . \n\n       \n\n Here\u2019s to all we can do together in 2013. \n\n\n\n           \n\n See what others had to say about us this year: \n\n\n\n             \n\n Watch two of Jennifer's public talks: \n\n\n\n                     \n\n $2,733,782 \n\n\n\n                     \n\n $286,257 \n\n  \n\n                     \n\n $280,896 \n\n  \n\n                     \n\n Civic Commons & Peer Network \n\n\n\n                     \n\n $324,140 \n\n  \n\n                             \n\n $2,704,565 \n\n\n\n                             \n\n $293,839 \n\n\n\n                             \n\n $636,600 \n\n\n\n                             \n\n $889,506 \n\n\n\n                             \n\n $126,144 \n\n\n\n                             \n\n $1,946 \n\n\n\n                             \n\n $120,455 \n\n\n\n"}, {"full_text_rss": 0, "media_id": 5704, "description": "<p>On the first weekend in June, civic activists, technology experts, and entrepreneurs around the country will gather together for the National Day of Civic Hacking.

The White House development team drew on feedback from the hackthaon to improve the API and is adding code from its projects to a software development kit (SDK).\u00a0 \n\n \n\n For the National Day of Civic Hacking, participants will focus on producing full, production ready apps and visualization tools that will be featured on the We the People website and made available under an open source license. \n\n \n\n  Apply for the National Day of Civic Hacking at the White House . \n\n \n\n The deadline for applications is 5:00pm on Friday, April 19.\u00a0 \n\n \n\n Those selected to attend the hackathon in person will be notified by email and\u00a0invited to join us at the White House on June 1. If you're not able to attend in person, you can still take part. On May 1, we'll open a public repo on GitHub where you'll\u00a0be free to collaborate\u00a0with other participants and the White House development team as we begin working on our projects.\u00a0Follow\u00a0 @WHWeb \u00a0on Twitter for updates and details. \n\n \n\n Petitions on We the People have been a catalyst for change, shaping a number of important policy discussions throughout the Administration. For example, this past January someone created a petition in favor of allowing consumers to unlock their cell phones. This wasn't an issue the White House had previously taken a position on, but when\u00a0more than\u00a0114,000\u00a0people signed the petition, policy experts across the Administration sat down, discussed the issues it raised, and concluded\u00a0that the petitioners were exactly right. The White House announced its agreement in March via an  official response . \n\n \n\n This API is part of an effort, not only to broaden the conversation taking place via We the People, but to make the medium of that conversation as flexible, open, and transparent as possible. By building and releasing applications that leverage the API, and by making it possible for other platforms to connect with We the People, you'll be making it easier for others to take part in that conversation.\u00a0 \n\n \n\n The need for a broad, inclusive conversation extends to this hackathon as well. The most creative ideas, and the best solutions, often emerge when a diverse group comes together and each person contributes from their own, unique perspective. We hope that hackers from all backgrounds, men and women, young and old, will apply. \n\n \n\n If you have the skills necessary to work with APIs and develop visualizations, tools, or other services that rely their data, we want to hear from you.  Submit your application today . \n\n\n\n"}, {"full_text_rss": 0, "media_id": 1720, "description": "<p>Hackers often encounter public uncertainty at their craft\u2019s virtue. With the forthcoming <a href=\u201dhttp://hackforchange.org/\u201d>National Day of Civic Hacking</a>, however, their celebration of creativity, collaboration and technical innovation sees its first \u201cnational holiday.\u201d <p>Groups leading the June 1-2 event include <a href=\u201dhttp://www.rhok.org/\u201d>Random Hacks of Kindness</a>, <a href=\u201dhttp://codeforamerica.org/\u201d>Code for America</a> and the investment firm <a href=\u201dhttp://innovationendeavors.com/\u201d>Innovation Endeavors</a>. They\u2019re working with government agencies such as the U.S. Census Bureau, NASA and the U.S. Dept. of Labor to host activities which invite everyone to join the \u201ccivic hacker\u201d community. <p>The weekend\u2019s events will include block parties, meetups and hackathons, where participants will gather to prototype solutions to community-specific problems. \u201cChallenges\u201d will be identified, and made available to the public shortly before the event in each town, with invitations issued to so-called citizen hackers. <p>\u201cWe believe that government agencies must find groups of people, bring them together around an issue or problem that needs to be fixed, then step out of the way,\u201d said Nicholas Skytland, program manager of NASA\u2019s Open Innovation Program and one of the participants in the weekend\u2019s events. \u201c ... let the collective energy of the people involved solve problems in creative and imaginative ways that we would never have done ourselves.\u201d <span id=\"more-229871\"></span> <p>At the start of the 2013 fiscal year, NASA tweaked the mission of its open government group to sharpen interest in \u201copen innovation\u201d. For the event, the space agency will offer a challenge and, potentially, an open data set to support it. NASA representatives also will attend the event to help developers as they develop their solutions. <p> <p>That some of the participants are still wrestling with how much prominence to give the term \u201chacking\u201d underscores why the event is being held in the first place: to put into the collective conscience the notion of the hacker as part of a digital bucket brigade&#8212;as worthwhile, even heroic, problem solvers. <p>\u201cThis is about recognizing the power of a new form of civic engagement,\u201d said Dr. Michael Brennan of SecondMuse, a PR agency helping to organize the hacking weekend. <p>While some of the cities already signed up to host events remain skittish, others are planning to advertise their interest with banners on the side of public spaces like a City Hall, Brennan added. <p> The White House itself <a href=\u201dhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/04/05/national-day-civic-hacking-white-house\u201d>blogged about the hacking holiday</a>, and will be hosting its second hackathon June 1. Invitees will be tasked with improving the popular <em>We The People</em> petition website, with the results released under an open-source licence. <p> \u201cIt\u2019s a great cause and we\u2019re excited to take part,\u201d wrote White House online staffer Peter Welsch in his post. <p>At NASA, Skytland is responsible for leading the agency\u2019s digital strategy and open government plan, with his goals including putting more high-value data sets online, promoting the use of open source software and creating more opportunities for the public to engage with NASA. He has experience planning hackathons, envisioning space exploration missions, designing next-gen space suits, training astronauts, developing open-source software and encouraging partnerships between government, industry, academia and other organizations. <p> Right now, he\u2019s especially focused on how the government \u2013 and the space agency \u2013 can benefit from mass collaboration. <p> \u201cWe understand that the future of technology will be largely determined by citizens who will design, build, and hack their own technology together, and (the civic hacking event) is a way for us to really tap into that intelligence,\u201d Skytland said. \u201cOur goal is to inspire, incentivize and equip these communities to develop tomorrow\u2019s technology and for NASA to be a part of the conversation.\u201d <p> The agency has already let anyone who\u2019s interested get a peek under the hood to see the mountain of information on countless subjects that NASA has collected. At <a href=\u201dhttp://data.nasa.gov\u201d>data.nasa.gov</a>, NASA lists more than 500 data sets that range from engineering data, charts and specifications to earth sciences data, atmospheric and environmental data and mission operations data relating to things like flight programs and mission control. <p> \u201cWe are interested in solving the toughest challenges, and we definitely don\u2019t have all the answers,\u201d Skytland said. \u201cBy tapping into a global community of expertise, partnering with researchers, scientists, technologists, academics and entrepreneurs as well as collaborating directly with citizens and innovative organizations, we can develop solutions that we would have never come up with on our own. Solutions that may have lasting impacts on both NASA and the world.\u201d <p> Participants in the National Day of Civic Hacking will be encouraged to develop software, hardware, data visualization, and mobile/web applications. Challenges for the hacking event will be released about one month prior to the event, and there will be about 50 of them. <p> \u201cSelfishly, for NASA, we want to develop a map of innovation around the nation,\u201d Skytland said. \u201cSo this is a way for us to tap into talent in a way we haven\u2019t considered before. NASA does space exploration really well, and we collect a lot of data, but we don\u2019t always do those things in partnership with other agencies or the public. <p> \u201cThe idea of engaging a broad group of diverse people focused on pushing forward the development of a solution to a challenge \u2013 why this is so exciting is I personally feel the grand challenges of our time will require the talents of us all. Imagine what we could do if we focused on collaborating to improve something like the prosperity of our community over the course of a weekend. In general, this is not the kind of thing we do as a nation. This could be a movement focused on making the world a better place.\u201d <p> The full list of participating cities is at the <a href=\u201dhttp://hackforchange.org/#locations\u201d>Hack for

for first \"national holiday\" in their\u00a0honor \n\n\n\n \n\n  \u201cThe future of technology will be largely determined by citizens who will design, build, and hack their own\u201d  \n\n \n\n Hackers often encounter public uncertainty at their craft\u2019s virtue. With the forthcoming  National Day of Civic Hacking , however, their celebration of creativity, collaboration and technical innovation sees its first \u201cnational holiday.\u201d  \n\n\n\n Groups leading the June 1-2 event include  Random Hacks of Kindness ,  Code for America  and the investment firm  Innovation Endeavors . They\u2019re working with government agencies such as the U.S. Census Bureau, NASA and the U.S. Dept. of Labor to host activities which invite everyone to join the \u201ccivic hacker\u201d community.  \n\n\n\n The weekend\u2019s events will include block parties, meetups and hackathons, where participants will gather to prototype solutions to community-specific problems. \u201cChallenges\u201d will be identified, and made available to the public shortly before the event in each town, with invitations issued to so-called citizen hackers.  \n\n\n\n \u201cWe believe that government agencies must find groups of people, bring them together around an issue or problem that needs to be fixed, then step out of the way,\u201d said Nicholas Skytland, program manager of NASA\u2019s Open Innovation Program and one of the participants in the weekend\u2019s events. \u201c ... let the collective energy of the people involved solve problems in creative and imaginative ways that we would never have done ourselves.\u201d  \n\n\n\n \n\n At the start of the 2013 fiscal year, NASA tweaked the mission of its open government group to sharpen interest in \u201copen innovation\u201d. For the event, the space agency will offer a challenge and, potentially, an open data set to support it. NASA representatives also will attend the event to help developers as they develop their solutions.\n\n \n\n That some of the participants are still wrestling with how much prominence to give the term \u201chacking\u201d underscores why the event is being held in the first place: to put into the collective conscience the notion of the hacker as part of a digital bucket brigade\u2014as worthwhile, even heroic, problem solvers. \n\n \u201cThis is about recognizing the power of a new form of civic engagement,\u201d said Dr. Michael Brennan of SecondMuse, a PR agency helping to organize the hacking weekend.  \n\n While some of the cities already signed up to host events remain skittish, others are planning to advertise their interest with banners on the side of public spaces like a City Hall, Brennan added.\n\n The White House itself  blogged about the hacking holiday , and will be hosting its second hackathon June 1. Invitees will be tasked with improving the popular  We The People  petition website, with the results released under an open-source licence.\n\n \u201cIt\u2019s a great cause and we\u2019re excited to take part,\u201d wrote White House online staffer Peter Welsch in his post. \n\n At NASA, Skytland is responsible for leading the agency\u2019s digital strategy and open government plan, with his goals including putting more high-value data sets online, promoting the use of open source software and creating more opportunities for the public to engage with NASA. He has experience planning hackathons, envisioning space exploration missions, designing next-gen space suits, training astronauts, developing open-source software and encouraging partnerships between government, industry, academia and other organizations.\n\n Right now, he\u2019s especially focused on how the government \u2013 and the space agency \u2013 can benefit from mass collaboration.\n\n \u201cWe understand that the future of technology will be largely determined by citizens who will design, build, and hack their own technology together, and (the civic hacking event) is a way for us to really tap into that intelligence,\u201d Skytland said. \u201cOur goal is to inspire, incentivize and equip these communities to develop tomorrow\u2019s technology and for NASA to be a part of the conversation.\u201d\n\n The agency has already let anyone who\u2019s interested get a peek under the hood to see the mountain of information on countless subjects that NASA has collected. At  data.nasa.gov , NASA lists more than 500 data sets that range from engineering data, charts and specifications to earth sciences data, atmospheric and environmental data and mission operations data relating to things like flight programs and mission control.\n\n \u201cWe are interested in solving the toughest challenges, and we definitely don\u2019t have all the answers,\u201d Skytland said. \u201cBy tapping into a global community of expertise, partnering with researchers, scientists, technologists, academics and entrepreneurs as well as collaborating directly with citizens and innovative organizations, we can develop solutions that we would have never come up with on our own. Solutions that may have lasting impacts on both NASA and the world.\u201d\n\n Participants in the National Day of Civic Hacking will be encouraged to develop software, hardware, data visualization, and mobile/web applications. Challenges for the hacking event will be released about one month prior to the event, and there will be about 50 of them.\n\n \u201cSelfishly, for NASA, we want to develop a map of innovation around the nation,\u201d Skytland said. \u201cSo this is a way for us to tap into talent in a way we haven\u2019t considered before. NASA does space exploration really well, and we collect a lot of data, but we don\u2019t always do those things in partnership with other agencies or the public.\n\n \u201cThe idea of engaging a broad group of diverse people focused on pushing forward the development of a solution to a challenge \u2013 why this is so exciting is I personally feel the grand challenges of our time will require the talents of us all. Imagine what we could do if we focused on collaborating to improve something like the prosperity of our community over the course of a weekend. In general, this is not the kind of thing we do as a nation. This could be a movement focused on making the world a better place.\u201d\n\n \t\t\t      69k backers. $10m in the can.

Rebellion Around Your Data \n\n\n\n       The world\u2019s largest chip maker wants to see a new kind of economy bloom around personal data.   \n\n\n\n   \n\n The economic importance of personal information has outstripped the legislation that governs it.  \n\n\n\n           \n\n Data science and personal information are converging to shape the Internet\u2019s most powerful and surprising consumer products. \n\n\n\n  \n\n Intel is a $53-billion-a-year company that enjoys a near monopoly on the computer chips that go into PCs. But when it comes to the data underlying big companies like Facebook and Google, it says it wants to \u201creturn power to the people.\u201d \n\n \n\n Intel Labs, the company\u2019s R&D arm, is launching an initiative around what it calls the \u201cdata economy\u201d\u2014how consumers might capture more of the value of their personal information, like digital records of their their location or work history. To make this possible, Intel is funding hackathons to urge developers to explore novel uses of personal data. It has also paid for a rebellious-sounding website called  We the Data,  featuring raised fists and stories comparing Facebook to Exxon Mobil. \n\n \n\n Intel\u2019s effort to stir a debate around \u201cyour data\u201d is just one example of how some companies\u2014and society more broadly\u2014are grappling with a basic economic asymmetry of the big data age: they\u2019ve got the data, and we don\u2019t. \n\n \n\n Internet firms like Google and Amazon are concentrating valuable data about consumers at an unprecedented scale as people click around the Web. But regulations and social standards haven\u2019t kept up with the technical and economic shift, creating a widening gap between data haves and have-nots. \n\n \n\n \u201cAs consumers, we have no right to know what companies know about us. As companies, we have few restrictions on what we can do with this data,\u201d says Hilary Mason, chief data scientist at Bit.ly, a social-media company in New York. \u201cEven though people derive value, and companies derive value, it\u2019s totally chaotic who has rights to what, and it\u2019s making people uncomfortable.\u201d \n\n \n\n In February, for instance, legislators in California introduced the first U.S. law to give individuals a complete view into their online personas. The \u201cRight to Know\u201d bill would let citizens of the state demand a detailed report showing all the information about them that companies like LinkedIn or Google had stored, and whom they had shared it with. \n\n \n\n That bill quickly got shelved under pressure from lobbyists for technology companies, who called it \u201cunworkable\u201d and financially damaging to Internet firms and said lawmakers don\u2019t understand \u201chow the Internet works.\u201d Some of the data covered in the bill, like a computer\u2019s IP address, or location, is so basic to communication between machines on the Internet that companies admitted they don\u2019t even know where it ends up. \n\n \n\n And that\u2019s the wider dilemma: our personal data is inextricably tied to \u201cbig data\u201d\u2014those far larger data sets that now power many of the online services we use. If you don\u2019t tell a navigation app where you are, it can\u2019t tell you where to turn, or tell others there\u2019s traffic ahead. One doesn\u2019t work without the other. What\u2019s more, the economic importance of products fueled with personal data is growing rapidly.  According to the Boston Consulting Group , as methods for basing transactions on a person\u2019s digital records have spread from banks to retailers and other sectors ,  the financial value that companies derived from personal data in Europe was $72 billion in 2011. The consultants concluded that \u201cpersonal data has become a new form of currency.\u201d \n\n \n\n Yet that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a currency easily understood or traded on by individuals .  Although a few startups have attempted to help individuals monetize their personal facts (see \u201c A Dollar for Your Data \u201d), the truth is that information about people\u2019s identity and habits has financial value mostly in the aggregate. A single user\u2019s value to Facebook, for instance, is only about $5 a year. Mason, the Bit.ly executive, says trying to put a value on one person\u2019s data is like calculating the value of one unmatched shoe. \u201cAnd here we are talking about sets of millions or billions of shoes,\u201d she says. \u201cI just don\u2019t think that data plays by the economics of any goods we are familiar with.\u201d \n\n \n\n Some believe the market may have already found the right economic balance. \u201cIt seems like we have a working model where companies own our data and we\u2019re okay with that because of the free stuff, personalization, and convenience we get in return,\u201d says Gam Dias, CEO of First Retail, an e-commerce consulting company. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot I\u2019m going to do with my extra data anyway. I already know who I am and what I want.\u201d \n\n \n\n Intel this year judged the questions swirling around personal data important enough to launch a \u201cData Economy Initiative,\u201d a multiyear study whose goal is to explore new uses of technology that might let people benefit more directly, and in new ways, from their own data, says Ken Anderson, a cultural anthropologist who is in charge of the project. \n\n\n\n \n\n Anderson, who once helped Apple develop the sliding application bar that appears on Mac computers (after studying how people organized their desks and stacked items on shelves), says Intel believes technology based on personal data may end up in the control of individuals, in much the same way that mainframe computers gave way to PCs. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what you look at in terms of technology. Usually, there is this move toward individualization,\u201d he says. \n\n \n\n Intel, which has started surveying consumer opinions, has also been supporting efforts like  a competition  in New York last fall in which developers wrote apps for the elderly and single mothers. It\u2019s also underwriting the  National Day of Civic Hacking , an event focused on new uses of municipal data being released by city governments, such as records of health inspections. \n\n \n\n It\u2019s too early to say just what kinds of products might result for Intel, Anderson says,. \u201cWhen you talk about the data economy, it\u2019s really something that doesn\u2019t yet exist,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are people who [are] trying to control a lot of your personal data.

of economy bloom around personal data.  \n\n \n\n Intel is a $53-billion-a-year company that enjoys a near monopoly on the computer chips that go into PCs. But when it comes to the data underlying big companies like Facebook and Google, it says it wants to \u201creturn power to the people.\u201d \n\n \n\n Intel Labs, the company\u2019s R&D arm, is launching an initiative around what it calls the \u201cdata economy\u201d\u2014how consumers might capture more of the value of their personal information, like digital records of their their location or work history. To make this possible, Intel is funding hackathons to urge developers to explore novel uses of personal data. It has also paid for a rebellious-sounding website called  We the Data , featuring raised fists and stories comparing Facebook to Exxon Mobil. \n\n \n\n Intel\u2019s effort to stir a debate around \u201cyour data\u201d is just one example of how some companies\u2014and society more broadly\u2014are grappling with a basic economic asymmetry of the big data age: they\u2019ve got the data, and we don\u2019t. \n\n \n\n Internet firms like Google and Amazon are concentrating valuable data about consumers at an unprecedented scale as people click around the Web. But regulations and social standards haven\u2019t kept up with the technical and economic shift, creating a widening gap between data haves and have-nots. \n\n \n\n \u201cAs consumers, we have no right to know what companies know about us. As companies, we have few restrictions on what we can do with this data,\u201d says Hilary Mason, chief data scientist at Bit.ly, a social-media company in New York. \u201cEven though people derive value, and companies derive value, it\u2019s totally chaotic who has rights to what, and it\u2019s making people uncomfortable.\u201d \n\n \n\n In February, for instance, legislators in California introduced the first U.S. law to give individuals a complete view into their online personas. The \u201cRight to Know\u201d bill would let citizens of the state demand a detailed report showing all the information about them that companies like LinkedIn or Google had stored, and whom they had shared it with. \n\n \n\n That bill quickly got shelved under pressure from lobbyists for technology companies, who called it \u201cunworkable\u201d and financially damaging to Internet firms and said lawmakers don\u2019t understand \u201chow the Internet works.\u201d Some of the data covered in the bill, like a computer\u2019s IP address, or location, is so basic to communication between machines on the Internet that companies admitted they don\u2019t even know where it ends up. \n\n \n\n And that\u2019s the wider dilemma: our personal data is inextricably tied to \u201cbig data\u201d\u2014those far larger data sets that now power many of the online services we use. If you don\u2019t tell a navigation app where you are, it can\u2019t tell you where to turn, or tell others there\u2019s traffic ahead. One doesn\u2019t work without the other. What\u2019s more, the economic importance of products fueled with personal data is growing rapidly.  \n\n \n\n According to the  Boston Consulting Group , as methods for basing transactions on a person\u2019s digital records have spread from banks to retailers and other sectors, the financial value that companies derived from personal data in Europe was $72 billion in 2011. The consultants concluded that \u201cpersonal data has become a new form of currency.\u201d \n\n \n\n Yet that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a currency easily understood or traded on by individuals. Although a few startups have attempted to help individuals  monetize their personal facts , the truth is that information about people\u2019s identity and habits has financial value mostly in the aggregate. A single user\u2019s value to Facebook, for instance, is only about $5 a year. Mason, the Bit.ly executive, says trying to put a value on one person\u2019s data is like calculating the value of one unmatched shoe. \u201cAnd here we are talking about sets of millions or billions of shoes,\u201d she says. \u201cI just don\u2019t think that data plays by the economics of any goods we are familiar with.\u201d \n\n \n\n Some believe the market may have already found the right economic balance. \u201cIt seems like we have a working model where companies own our data and we\u2019re okay with that because of the free stuff, personalization, and convenience we get in return,\u201d says Gam Dias, CEO of First Retail, an e-commerce consulting company. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot I\u2019m going to do with my extra data anyway.

Intel chips are at the heart of servers THAT companies and government organizations use to crunch heavy loads of consumer data. And Intel also has come out with its own <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/2013/02/26/cloudera-who-intel-announces-its-own-hadoop-distribution/\">Hadoop distribution</a> for handling big data.</p> <p>The sort of rhetoric floating around the Wethedata.org site &#8212; &#8220;we are the customer, but our data are the product. &#8230; How do we regain more control over what happens to our data and what is targeted at us as a result?&#8221; &#8212; seems more likely to come from a nonprofit or even a government agency than from a collaboration that includes a corporation such as Intel. But that might help explain why the efforts are noteworthy.</p> <p>Intel isn&#8217;t the only one active on this front. <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/2013/05/15/how-stanfords-andreas-weigend-leads-by-example-in-pursuit-of-data-symmetry/\">Andreas Weigend</a>, a former chief scientist at Amazon.com, often raises the topic with executives in his consulting work with big companies around the world, partly because some data is simply wrong, and consumers ought not be penalized for it. And as the MIT Technology Review article notes, legislators have taken stabs at the issue, albeit with little success so far. </p> <p>Now that Intel is on board, perhaps more tech companies will join in and the prompt the tide to change. And if that happens, <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/2013/04/05/on-the-quest-to-data-ownership-lots-of-questions-lie-ahead/\">interesting questions</a> would arise, such as how exactly companies would roll out more data on its customers, whether companies should give consumers access to algorithms that factor into decision-making and how much visualization software and other tools should be made available.</p> <p><em>Feature image courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/gallery-78491p1.html\">Shutterstock user Lasse Kristensen</a>.</em></p> <br /> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\"

der Schlachtrufe der 60er Jahre. Ausgerechnet der 1968 gegr\u00fcndete Chip-Gigant Intel, dessen Gr\u00fcnder mit dem politischen Aufruhr jener Zeit wenig am Hut hatten, macht sich den Slogan inzwischen zueigen. Mit der Initiative  \"We the data\"  will Intel Verbrauchern mehr Macht \u00fcber ihre Daten geben,  berichtet   Technology Review  in seiner Online-Ausgabe. Hierf\u00fcr finanzieren die Intel Labs, die Forschungsabteilung des Konzerns, Entwickler-Wettbewerbe, die neuartige Anwendungen f\u00fcr pers\u00f6nliche Daten hervorbringen sollen.  \n\n \n\n Als Teil der Initiative hat Intel auch eine mehrj\u00e4hrige Studie gestartet, die \"Data Economy Initiative\". Sie soll herausfinden, wie Nutzer konkret von ihren Daten profitieren k\u00f6nnten, sagt Ken Anderson, Anthropologe in Diensten des Chip-Herstellers, der das Projekt leitet. \n\n \n\n Anderson hatte bei Apple fr\u00fcher das Men\u00fc-Balken-Konzept mitentwickelt, das auf Beobachtungen beruhte, wie Menschen Dinge auf ihren Schreibtischen anordnen und in H\u00e4ufchen sortieren. Intel sei \u00fcberzeugt davon, dass auf Personendaten basierende Technologien am Ende von den Individuen kontrolliert werden k\u00f6nnten, so wie industrielle Rechner den PCs gewichen seien und Computertechnik f\u00fcr jeden erm\u00f6glicht h\u00e4tten. \"Im Prinzip gibt es immer diese Bewegung hin zur Individualisierung\", sagt Anderson. \n\n \n\n Intel hat bereits verschiedene Entwickler-Wettbewerbe unterst\u00fctzt, darunter einen  \"Hackathon\" in New York , bei dem es um Apps f\u00fcr Senioren und alleinerziehende M\u00fctter ging. Es sponsert zudem den  National Day of Civic Hacking  Anfang Juni. US-Beh\u00f6rden werden Datens\u00e4tze zur Verf\u00fcgung stellen, an denen sich Hacker austoben d\u00fcrfen. Ziel sind neue Nutzungsideen f\u00fcr Beh\u00f6rdendaten, die den B\u00fcrgern dienen. \n\n \n\n Intel beteiligt sich mit diesen Aktivit\u00e4ten an der Debatte um Big Data, wem all die Daten eigentlich geh\u00f6ren, die t\u00e4glich in sozialen Netzwerken und Online-Diensten entstehen. Pikant: Auf der Webseite von \u201eWe the data\u201c findet sich sogar eine Geschichte, die Facebook mit dem umstrittenen \u00d6lkonzern Exxon Mobil vergleicht. Auf jeden Fall beweist der Chip-Hersteller ein gutes Gesp\u00fcr f\u00fcr die derzeitige Stimmungslage. \n\n\n\n \t\t\tKommentare lesen (3 Beitr\u00e4ge)\n\n         \n\n Als Gegenreaktion auf die G\u00e4ngelung durch Internetkonzerne bauen Pioniere ihre eigene Infrastruktur auf. \n\n\n\n                 Science-Fiction-Klassiker gelten als Propheten des technologischen Wandels.

Those people, who work inside Intel&#8217;s Interaction and Experience Research Lab, study how people around the world use technology and how technology affects cultures.</p>\n<p>Lately, the researchers have been exploring the implications of the changing role of data in the computing ecosystem. The idea is to figure out how the growing openness of data from companies and governments could present business opportunities for Intel, said Brandon Barnett, director of business innovation at Intel.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s only natural that this is a bit amorphous &#8212; Intel doesn&#8217;t know exactly what will come out of it all. But as it throws support behind data-democratization efforts, the company has in mind a few use cases that hint at where commercialization could come in to play.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An Intel researcher has <a href=\"http://www.intelfreepress.com/news/can-big-data-prevent-allergy-attacks/5625\">built an application</a> on top of multiple publicly available data sets depicting the trees and their pollen activity in Portland, Ore. The idea is for people to be able to find routes around the city that avoid trees that could cause allergy attacks. Without the application, people who move to town with allergies but no tech savvy might have a hard time commuting.</li>\n<li>High school students looking at colleges should be able to plug in information about their academic performance and non-accredited extracurricular activities and get recommendations for schools they should check out, based on demographic data, grant availability and workforce demand. While the data might be out there, it&#8217;s not all navigable in one place, and it&#8217;s not interactive. (This is one area that Intel <a href=\"http://www.hackforchange.org/challenge/help-students-thrive-education-challenge?\">wants people to work on</a>.)</li>\n<li>Intel let Londoners look at their home energy consumption and compare it with others in the same age bracket or type of home. The trick here was to open up the data that&#8217;s relevant to certain users and to display it in a simple way. (Opower <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/2013/02/28/big-data-use-cases-abound-at-strata-conference/\">can do something related</a> &#8212; compare people&#8217;s energy consumption with that of their neighbors.)</li>\n<li>It could be possible to suggest better public-transit routes by crossing people&#8217;s transit habits with data on lateness of buses based on traffic. That sort of data can otherwise remain in a silo and never get shown to people who could actually benefit from alerts based on it.</li>\n<li>A next-generation music application might be able to watch what music a person listens to, and then offer a ticket to see a preferred band when it stops by a local venue on a day the person has some free time. Such a service would take personal data and run with it by removing the hassle of identifying a band, checking out the tour schedule, finding a date that works and scoring a ticket.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s nice to see that Intel has ordinary people in mind, at least for now. It&#8217;s interested in constructing applications for lots of people to understand their own data and put it in context with outside data that&#8217;s narrowly tailored, &#8220;so we don&#8217;t end up with a bunch of hackers across the country coming up with better visualization tools,&#8221; Barnett said.</p>\n<p>Of course, more public-private data mixing and analyzing could bring about the need for more computing power, and Intel wants to be ready if and when that situation arises. Currently available chips might be up for the job, or maybe a new model will be warranted. Intel has shown willingness to make custom chips for a single webscale company, <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/05/facebook-and-intel/\">Facebook</a>, so delivering special equipment to fit a growing use case might not be unthinkable, assuming the scale is there.</p>\n<p><em>Feature image courtesy of <a

It\u2019s a harsh reminder that transparency doesn\u2019t not always lead to accountability. \n\n \n\n Other difficulties hackathon projects face include real world adoption of the apps created, as long as maintenance of apps and data sets. \u201cOne of the big challenges for a hackathon is the sustainability of an application,\u201d says Bryan Sivak, CTO of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. \u201cHow do we get people to continue working on these things?\u201d \n\n \n\n Still, Sivak is enthusiastic about the potential of open government and hackathons. \u201cWe have a lot of people who work at the Health and Human Services, but we want allow people who don\u2019t work there to take advantage of all the data that we have,\u201d he says. \n\n\n\n"}, {"full_text_rss": 0, "media_id": 6162, "description": "<p><a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2013/05/31/government-releases-unprecedented-amount-of-data-for-national-day-of-civic-hacking/national-day-of-civic-hacking/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-748886\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-748886\" alt=\"national day of civic hacking\" src=\"http://venturebeat.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/national-day-of-civic-hacking.png?w=500&#038;h=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /></a>Thousands of people are coming together this weekend to improve the American government.</p> <p>Tomorrow is the <a href=\"http://hackforchange.org/\" target=\"_blank\">National Day of Civic Hacking</a>.

phone, you have the hardware for complete digital studio in your pocket,\u201d says Jonathan Gay, co-founder of Explory. \n\n \n\n Gay previously built FutureSplash Animator along with Robert Tatsumi. The team was acquired by Macromedia and its app renamed \u201cFlash\u201d in the late 1990s. There, the duo met Peter Goldie, Gary Grossman, and Peter Santangeli \u2013 their other Explory founding team members. \n\n \n\n Explory is designed specifically for ease of use; its makers say it lets you create stories using photos, video, voice, and text in quick time. \n\n \n\n \u201cYou can add text and narration to turn your photos and videos into engaging stories with enduring value,\u201d says Peter Goldie. \n\n \n\n When you\u2019re ready to share your story, Explory stores it in the cloud and renders an optimized version of the story for a range of devices. The stories can be shared via social networks, email, or text messaging. \n\n \n\n Interestingly, the app offers an interactive experience as opposed to a linear video, which means the viewer has more control. \n\n \n\n \u201cExplory has a natural, touch interface. So when you\u2019re watching a story, if there\u2019s something you want to skip past, just swipe it off and move on to the next part. Or if something catches your eye and you want to dig deeper into one area of the story, you can choose to explore additional content,\u201d says the founding team. \n\n \n\n The app is in testing right now, and the team is using  Kickstarter  to raise $50,000 to cover software development and video hosting costs. \n\n \n\n The founders hope to ship the first Explory product this summer. It will be available on iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch to start. An Android version is planned for later this year. \n\n \n\n  Image Credit/Video Credit: Explory  \n\n\n\n \t\t\n\n \n\n \n\n  Big Data \n\n \n\n  Amazon Web Services speeds can vary by up to 200X depending\u00a0on\u00a0region  \n\n\n\n  Government releases \u2018unprecedented amount of data\u2019 for National Day of\u00a0Civic\u00a0Hacking  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Business \n\n \n\n  Who\u2019s really doing the learning in\u00a0your\u00a0startup?  \n\n\n\n  New app from Adobe Flash creators lets you explore facets\u00a0of\u00a0storytelling  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Cloud \n\n \n\n  Pitching an app?

See the event >\n\n     \n\n National Day of Civic Hacking Tackles \u2026 Backyard Chicken Farms \n\n\n\n \n\n Adam Englander is proof you can hack almost anything. He spent our national hacking day building technology capable of reinventing the chicken coop. \n\n \n\n Englander\u2019s wife, Robin, had been considering a chicken coop outside their home in Las Vegas, Nevada, so when Sin City sponsored a local hackathon to coincide with the inaugural  National Day of Civic Hacking , he decided to apply his software skills to the problems of poultry farming. \u201cShe grew up on a farm with horses and chickens in Florida,\u201d he says, \u201cso this was taking her back to her roots.\u201d \n\n \n\n Together with designer Nicholas Ballard and a local high-school student and developer named Michael Keating, he built a software platform he calls  Backyard Brood , an app designed to make life easier for backyard poultry farmers. It will help track egg production, flock health, and revenues, and it will supply information on raising chickens, processing poultry, building coops, and handling eggs. \n\n \n\n The platform is one of several apps to hatch from the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s  Backyard Poultry Farmer Challenge . The goal is to develop mobile and web-based tech that increases awareness of DIY chicken farming, a growing trend in cities and suburbs across the U.S, according to a recent  study  by the USDA. \n\n \n\n The USDA project is also part of a larger effort to  use tech \u00a0as a means of reducing costs, increasing output, and improving animal health on DYI farms. Even Kickstarter has seen a trend towards agriculture-related products, including  BuyPoultry , a mobile database to help consumers track where their poultry comes from. \n\n \n\n \u201cPeople want to get back closer to their food source,\u201d says veterinarian\u00a0Larry Rawson of the USDA\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) unit. Backyard chickens, he says, are relatively easy to raise, don\u2019t require much space, and lay tasty eggs. Plus, they\u2019re rather \u201cpersonable,\u201d making them the perfect mix of pet and protein source. \n\n \n\n In light of growing concerns over antibiotic resistance in big-business poultry farms, backyard farming could offer a solution \u2014 assuming novice farmers know what they\u2019re doing. \n\n \n\n Educating the public is the main reason the agency has sponsored the Backyard Poultry Farmer Challenge, which is now on its second go-round. The first round, which took place as part of the International NASA Space Apps Challenge in April, produced 25 different applications. The\u00a0 ChickenPotPi \u00a0project set out to develop a Raspberry Pi-based web server and farm management system to help farmers living in rural, Internet-poor areas manage their flocks. Others projects \u2014 such as  FarmDroid , Clucker!, and ChicksBook, which won the  People\u2019s Choice Award \u00a0through an open vote on Twitter \u2014 sought to create web-based, iOS, and Android apps that provide information on local chicken farming laws and ordinances, feed prices, best practices for taking care of chickens, and disease monitoring. \n\n \n\n In the spirit of the open challenge, most of these poultry app projects have laid out their code on Github or Dropbox for others to use. \n\n \n\n \u201cThis was our first foray into this world [of] working with citizens to help solve government challenges,\u201d says APHIS Chief Information Security Officer\u00a0Terri Gallagher. She and others are hoping the challenge will strengthen the already growing community of backyard poultry farmers. This new wave of projects could also help create a repository of data that the government and amateur and professional backyard farmers could use to better track bird health and local poultry product production. Currently, none of the backyard poultry data is being collected by the government, Gallagher says. \n\n\n\n"}, {"full_text_rss": 0, "media_id": 6244, "description": "<img alt=\"Author Picture\" height=\"80\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-LK_dMxzl5_A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAFtAs/P1FstgH_xlQ/photo.jpg?sz=80\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;\" /><em>By Patrick Copeland, Google.org</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Cross-posted with the <a href=\"http://blog.google.org/\">Google.org Blog</a></em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn June 1st and 2nd, thousands of developers from across the U.S. came together at nearly 100 different locations to participate in the first ever <a href=\"http://hackforchange.org/\">National Day of Civic Hacking</a>.

One of 95 events held simultaneously across the country, Bangor&#8217;s hackathon was organized by Programmableweb&#8217;s own Garret Wilkin.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://blog.programmableweb.com/wp-content/2013-06-05-10.53.28-am-600x115.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"115\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-54161\" /></p>\n<p>Projects included tracking city vehicles, analyzing car crash data, and creating a prototype for an exhibit at the Children&#8217;s Discovery Museum that \u00a0children could control with a laptop or cell phone.</p>\n<p>A proclamation of support from the Bangor City Council was used as a template for blessings by governments holding events in other cities.

On Sunday, just prior to presentation time they were in the process of building an API that would \u00a0use the Google Maps API and incorporate data through the Yahoo weather API to start discerning what if any role weather played in the crashes. The aim is simple: take the dent <em>out</em> of the universe.</p>\n<p>Both groups faced different versions of the same problem: the data was already there, but not in a very useful form. With the crash data, the city has years of information, but much of it is stored in computers that are no longer in use or stored on paper. In the case of the plow trucks, the city does not collect data in real \u00a0time but only downloads it when trucks stop for refueling. Worse, the system is 13 years old, and can&#8217;t actually output the data in a usable format.</p>\n<p>But in a move that illustrates what is possible, Welch noted that a vendor had offered a new system for $20,000 to outfit 100 trucks. The hackers estimated their version could cover the fleet for $3,000. Even adding in the cost of a plan to cover the transmission of data through the cellular network, the hackers&#8217; proposal represents a potentially huge cost savings.</p>\n<p>In being the lead instigator for the event, Wilkin sees a connection between civic hackathons like this one and student internships in tech. His aim is a revolution in tech education in Maine. The change may already be under way. Of the 25 plus hackers, two of them were high school students, junior Ryan Toth and senior Yuval Boss, mentioned earlier.</p>\n<p>Toth told Programmableweb that in rural Maine, building tech community is key. He plays a role as a tech person at his high school and holds down a tech job while being a student. Toth is entirely self-taught, something he is proud of. Yet he is quick to point out the drawbacks. He needs to be working with people he can learn from. The hackathon was a great opportunity to network, look at problem sets and dig in&#8211;together.</p>\n<p>This seems set to continue well past the actual event.\u00a0<a href=\"http://mainecivichackday.com/solve/\">Problem sets</a> the group is working on will form the agenda for the foreseeable future, long after the hackathon concluded.</p>\n<br /><p

"story_text": " \n\n  As the smell of solder wafted in the air from hardware and software techies working together, the first annual  Maine Civic Hackday , a local hackathon that was part of the  National Day of Civic Hacking  got underway in Bangor, Maine. Held June 1 and 2, it marked the beginning of what promises to be a global sea change in putting government data to a wide variety of uses, using APIs. One of 95 events held simultaneously across the country, Bangor\u2019s hackathon was organized by Programmableweb\u2019s own Garret Wilkin. \n\n\n\n \n\n Projects included tracking city vehicles, analyzing car crash data, and creating a prototype for an exhibit at the Children\u2019s Discovery Museum that \u00a0children could control with a laptop or cell phone. \n\n \n\n A proclamation of support from the Bangor City Council was used as a template for blessings by governments holding events in other cities. Government backing served as a reminder that a lot is at stake in putting to use what governments have most: data. \n\n \n\n Among the 25 participants, Derick Slopey Chris Roberts, Nate Welch and others worked on one project that could be of critical importance to the city\u2013and to all cities dependent on snow plows.\u00a0Using the Google Maps API, they created a program to track plow trucks, with the idea that, during a snow storm, residents and the city government will be able to see which roads have been plowed recently, potentially smoothing out harrowing commutes. \n\n \n\n Meanwhile, the hardware crew in the group tricked out an arduino with two shields to grab GPS data and feed it through a cell phone, with an eye toward later being able to transmit other data. This will include whether the truck has been sanding, when it was actually plowing (as opposed to just traveling to the start of its plow route). \n\n \n\n The hardware creators took the tracking device for a test drive around the city, broadcasting so the software team could record results. (See graphic.) \n\n\n\n \n\n Meanwhile, a second group that included Trevor Metivier, Yuval Boss and Ryan Toth, worked with Bangor traffic data and the Google Maps API to display the number and frequency of crashes at intersections throughout the city. On Sunday, just prior to presentation time they were in the process of building an API that would \u00a0use the Google Maps API and incorporate data through the Yahoo weather API to start discerning what if any role weather played in the crashes. The aim is simple: take the dent  out  of the universe. \n\n \n\n Both groups faced different versions of the same problem: the data was already there, but not in a very useful form. With the crash data, the city has years of information, but much of it is stored in computers that are no longer in use or stored on paper. In the case of the plow trucks, the city does not collect data in real \u00a0time but only downloads it when trucks stop for refueling. Worse, the system is 13 years old, and can\u2019t actually output the data in a usable format. \n\n \n\n But in a move that illustrates what is possible, Welch noted that a vendor had offered a new system for $20,000 to outfit 100 trucks. The hackers estimated their version could cover the fleet for $3,000. Even adding in the cost of a plan to cover the transmission of data through the cellular network, the hackers\u2019 proposal represents a potentially huge cost savings. \n\n \n\n In being the lead instigator for the event, Wilkin sees a connection between civic hackathons like this one and student internships in tech. His aim is a revolution in tech education in Maine. The change may already be under way. Of the 25 plus hackers, two of them were high school students, junior Ryan Toth and senior Yuval Boss, mentioned earlier. \n\n \n\n Toth told Programmableweb that in rural Maine, building tech community is key. He plays a role as a tech person at his high school and holds down a tech job while being a student. Toth is entirely self-taught, something he is proud of. Yet he is quick to point out the drawbacks. He needs to be working with people he can learn from. The hackathon was a great opportunity to network, look at problem sets and dig in\u2013together. \n\n \n\n This seems set to continue well past the actual event.\u00a0 Problem sets  the group is working on will form the agenda for the foreseeable future, long after the hackathon concluded. \n\n\n\n"}, {"full_text_rss": 0, "media_id": 5704, "description": "<p><img alt=\"White House hackathon logo\" src=\"/sites/default/files/image/ndoch-0.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>This past Saturday, more than 11,000&nbsp;civic activists, technology experts, and entrepreneurs around the country came together for the National Day of Civic Hacking.

Civic Hacking. Cities across the country will invite programmers to rally together and improve local government one line of code at a time. \n\n\n\n \t\t\t'Steve Jobs' and 'The Help' dominate reading lists in many American cities\n\n \t\t\n\n In New York, more than 80 teams have signed up for  NYC  Big Apps, a competition in which people hunt for digital solutions to the city's problems. Projects range from the serious (software that compiles crime, garbage, and other city statistics to create a quality-of-life index) to the amusing (a game in which players race to claim territory in the city by snapping photos of billboards with their cellphones \u2013 if an ad isn't in New York's official database, the billboard is flagged as likely being illegal). \n\n\t\t\n\n \n\n Many of these projects would be impossible without a recent shift in American cities. Mayors in New York,  Chicago , and elsewhere have opened up a fire hose of data about their cities. This flood of information has allowed city workers to stay on top of problems \u2013 some of which they never knew existed \u2013 and has helped launch new businesses within the city limits. \n\n\n\n \"When I joined as chief data officer, the initial goal for releasing all of this data was transparency,\" says Brett Goldstein, who heads Chicago's Department of Innovation and Technology. \"But along the way, we learned a couple of really interesting things. We learned that open data can do so much more than that.\" \n\n\n\n About a year ago, Scott Robbin, a programmer in Chicago, approached Mr. Goldstein with an idea. He wanted an application that could send e-mails or text messages to residents as a street sweeper approached their homes, giving people an extra reminder to move their cars. Goldstein liked the idea \u2013 he'd received a few tickets of his own \u2013 but his team would likely never find time to create such an app. It didn't need to. The city found the data, published it online, and let the community take it from there. Shortly after the database went public, Mr. Robbin launched SweepAround.Us as a free online service. \n\n\n\n Another app, SpotHero, uses a mixture of city data and business partnerships to sniff out nearby parking spots. The local company recently raised $2.5 million in venture-capital funding and has expanded its operation from Chicago to Milwaukee and Washington. \n\n\n\n Goldstein says services such as SweepAround.Us and SpotHero are a win-win for Chicago. The newly released data made the city government more transparent, helped start businesses, and led to useful tools for residents. \n\n\n\n Chicago is not the only city trying to code its way toward better government.

the attention this week on the uses (and possible abuses) of big data for national security, it is easy to overlook all of the ways that data can be used in an uncontroversially helpful manner. This idea of benign big data (and the\u00a0 people who love it ) was behind the  National Day of Civic Hacking \u00a0which sponsored 95 events, in 38 states, 83 cities and 2 territories\u00a0last weekend. In the locavore spirit of the event, I frequented my local hack group in Portland, Maine. One of that event\u2019s co-organizers, Sam\u00a0Mateosian of  Big Room Studios , pointed me to a wonderful (perhaps\u00a0apocryphal) story about the origin of the term \u201chacker\u201d that places it firmly in the American patriotic tradition. \n\n  \n\n Charlie Auvermann, the\u00a0Executive Director of the\u00a0 Development Authority of Dawson County , north of Atlanta, recounted a family story that found its way into the national email thread for the planners of the NDoCH: \n\n \n\n  \n\n I got a huge amount of push back on the \u201chacker\u201d term here locally. We are a rural suburb of Atlanta so conservative is a very common theme to everything. Upon explaining what it meant in this context people acted like they have then been educated. Still I have to explain it every time to everyone. \n\n   \n\n It was my father that helped with this problem. He is 92, active and a veteran of WWII. He pointed out that he first heard the term \u201chacker\u201d during the early days of WWII in the South Pacific. The U.S. Navy was not prepared for war and was getting beaten pretty badly. He was there. When fighter planes would return from action they would be shot up and in many cases crashed on landing because their pilots were injured. Each night huge teams of mechanics would converge upon the wrecked planes and \u201chack\u201d at them, removing the good parts from several and building a new plane over night from all the salvaged pieces. He told me they were referred to as the \u201chacker details.\u201d That was because they had to use metal \u201chacksaws\u201d as they cut away the damaged panels of the planes. At 92 he seems to think that is the original root of the term because he said it was very commonly used during the war 60 years ago. \n\n   \n\n Since then I have searched old WWII files and actually found a couple of pictures of wrecked planes where they reference that they were now ready to be \u201chacked\u201d or listed as \u201chack jobs.\u201d I have no idea if the modern term actually came from that but it makes a very compelling story. \n\n   \n\n I have tried that story on a few groups since he told me that. They still ask the question and still do not like the term at first but after hearing the story they seem ok with the whole thing. Just a thought. \n\n\n\n \n\n The term \u201ccivic hacking\u201d is supposed to be a bit jarring. The point is not to just look at hacking in a new way, but to look at our civic engagement with all levels of government in a new way as well. I came away from my local event with a renewed optimism that we can solve all manner of difficulties through improvisatory and collaborative problem solving. \n\n  \n\n Before the event, I talked to NASA\u2019s  Nick Skytland \u00a0the manager of its Open Innovation Program and director of the agency\u2019s\u00a0 Open Government Plan \u00a0and digital strategy, who is one of the driving forces behind this movement. My first question, of course, is what does NASA have to do with civic hacking and with things on Earth altogether? Skytland answered that \u201cNASA is a pretty creative agency,\u201d that runs on open governance. I had to think about that, because aside from some recent music videos (\u201c Space Oddity \u201d and one of the better parodies of \u201c  Gangnam Style \u201c), my mind still goes to John Glenn and  The Right Stuff . \n\n  \n\n Skytland sees his role at NASA as helping to find ways to bring creativity out of government employees, to extend the NASA model for addressing creative challenges. And on the other side, he wants the rest of us to feel that government is accessible to our ideas and talents. \u201cOnly very recently, you couldn\u2019t participate government except to vote or to protest,\u201d he says, and then goes on to point out \u201cthe role technology is playing in changing the way we approach government.\u201d \n\n  \n\n \u201cThe government needs to open up challenges and data sets,\u201d says Skytland, so that citizens can get involved in the problems of governance. He sees the younger generation as being very altruistic and looking for, \u201csomething to do on weekends to contribute back.\u201d This past weekend showed me both the willingness of people in my community to\u00a0sacrifice a truly beautiful June weekend and geek out on some very local problems. \n\n  \n\n  Maine Civic Hack Day Portland \u00a0was in many ways an atypical hackathon, but it showed me some interesting things about the uniqueness of Portland as well as some of the potential benefits of what civic hacking might become. \n\n  \n\n Portland, Maine, has a large  creative  and\u00a0 entrepreneurial \u00a0community. We are masters (and perhaps somewhat victims) of the gig economy. But straight up developers are in short supply. This gave the Portland event more of the feeling of an extended meetup than a full fledged hackathon, and barely any actual code got written or data consumed during the weekend. Worth noting was the gender breakdown at the Portland event, about one third female. To anyone who frequents hacking events, this is a (wonderfully) high proportion. The fact that the event was light on code, however, does not mean that the effort was not productive or that there is not a lot to learn from what happened. \n\n  \n\n The way civic hacking works is that\u00a0representatives\u00a0from government agencies, non-profits and community groups bring \u201cchallenges\u201d to the\u00a0assembled\u00a0group of hackers. After a series of short pitch presentations, the participants vote on the projects they are the most interested in and break up into groups to dig in. In Portland, we had\u00a0representatives\u00a0from the city government, two environmental non-profits, an economic development organization and one local small business owner. The Mayor of Portland,  Michael Brennan , even showed up for the pitches. Now that\u2019s high-level buy-in! \n\n  \n\n For me, it was really interesting to see what local organizations need done. In Portland\u2019s case, the focus was completely local. No one was advocating for any of the  national challenges \u00a0or looking for ways of using any of the provided datasets from  Hack for Change . But at whatever level a civic hacking group engages, it is an opportunity to look at the balance of skills required to skills available in the community. I think this is one of the secrets to grassroots job creation and it is a reason to get students, from middle school on up, involved in civic projects like this. \n\n  \n\n If you talk to business owners, they will frequently complain that they cannot fill certain technical positions, that their local community does not have the talent and they have to look elsewhere. What is required, I think, is to radically shorten this loop between what needs to be done and local people (quickly) developing the skills to fulfill these needs. Hackathons of all sorts are great for this kind of spontaneous, collaborative learning. \n\n  \n\n Another theme raised by what happened in Portland is the difference between coding and thinking about code. It is, of course, possible to get mired in the meta, and not engage with any actual problem. The great benefit of the hacking approach is that you actually get your hands dirty and solve something. But a lof of how a coding problem is solved has to do with the way the initial scope is framed. The results from a \u201ccitizen science\u201d project for the\u00a0 Casco Bay Estuary Partnership , presented by co-organizer  Sam Frankel , for instance, involved framing out a series of options for how to proceed with a mobile data collection app for its volunteers. \n\n  \n\n No actual code got written for the Estuary\u00a0Partnership, but they received the\u00a0equivalent\u00a0of high-level consulting that will enable them to move their discussion along and consider whether to implement using existing free and paid software or to write a grant to build something bespoke. In the process of engaging with the challenge, the participants looked carefully at a market niche and may well have come up with ideas for civic or commercial projects to pursue further. This, to me, is one of the great implicit benefits of civic hacking, to explore ideas and ways of working that are outside of your usual field of expertise and thereby expand your own scope and that of your local community. \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\n\n I am a content strategist, designer and developer. I use my experience as a magazine art director and web editor to help publishers, marketers, non-profits and self-branded individuals tell their stories in words and images. I follow all of the technologies that relate to the content business and try to identify the opportunities and pitfalls that these technologies pose. At the same time I am immersed in certain sectors through my content practice and am always looking to find connections between the worlds of neurology, economics, entertainment, travel and mobile technology.

Census Bureau API to Create Innovative App and Infographics  \n\n\n\n \n\n  Over 11,000 people participated in the first annual  National Day of Civic Hacking  on June 1st and 2nd, 2013. At the event, developers collaborated with government agencies and entrepreneurs to create applications that help solve civic and social problems impacting local communities. Developers used a variety of public APIs and datasets to create their applications, including the  US Census Bureau API , which was used to create an interactive application and several infographics. The US Census Bureau API is the first API created by the US Census Bureau and was  released  to the public back in July 2012. \n\n\n\n The  Census Visual Data Explorer  application was created by Calvin Metcalf, Kyle Box and Laura Evans at the RHoK Boston \u2013 National Day of Civic Hacking. The app displays different types of Census data on a large map. There are four types of maps users can select from and the app displays the data by counties. Users can select US Census data from a drop down menu which includes data such as Inequality, Below Poverty Line, Per Capita Income, Population, On Food Stamps and much more.\n\n US Census data, along with data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, was used by Kevin Ohashi as part of  data analysis  and to create several infographics including a heat map and a bar chart.\n\n \u201cThese new applications offer inspiring examples of the kind of innovative tools that can be created using statistics from the American Community Survey. By accessing our data through the API, developers have harnessed the power of these statistics to create practical new applications that will give communities greater insight when answering real-world questions.\u201d\n\n Last year, the Census Bureau released its first mobile app, America\u2019s Economy. The app provides users with \u201c16 economic indicators\u201d from data available through the US Census Bureau, Bureau of Economic Analysis and Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n Developers interested in using the US Census Bureau API in web and mobile applications can find detailed documentation at the Census Bureau Developers  site . There is also helpful information at the Census Bureau API Developers  forum . \n\n\n\n"}, {"full_text_rss": 0, "media_id": 5927, "description": "<p><img src=\"http://blog.programmableweb.com/wp-content/2013-02-14-09.42.23-pm60-150x59.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"59\" align=\"right\" />Global interest in hackathons is growing fast, with many events booking out shortly after being announced.

Chian Gong is one of four founders of HACKtivate ED, held in San Francisco from June 14 \u2013 16. Shortly after the event\u2019s announcement, HACKtivate ED booked out its full run of 80 places, but later extended the invitation to allow for another 20 participants. By the time the education-based hackathon was starting, a further 78 developers had been added to the waiting list.</p>\n<p>Speaking to ProgrammableWeb, Ms Chian Gong, an Education Pioneers Analyst Fellow at Aspire Public Schools, said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIn reading through applications for this event, we found a few themes that participants reiterated:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Educators registered with a desire to learn more about technology and how it can help them both in and out of the classroom.</li>\n<li>Developers &amp; designers have registered for the opportunity to build connections with the education community.  In particular, I believe start-ups are hungry for more educator input and forming in-depth relationships with key stakeholders such as schools.</li>\n<li>Many people across all roles joined the event as a chance to engage in the ed tech community and to meet other passionate, like-minded folks with hopes of finding their niche or a potential partner.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are a number of factors that contribute to this growing popularity. It feels like this generation of folks have really latched onto the idea of social impact and social entrepreneurship: an idea that innovation can help serve our communities. Similarly, the spirit of entrepreneurship is infectious in the Bay Area.  People are passionate about building things and scrappy development.  These hackathons offer an opportunity to challenge yourself, build something tangible, and meet similar like-minded folks<br />\nwho might turn out to be your next co-founders! There&#8217;s also of course some street cred and incentive to participate in a hackathon for the visibility of pitching to impressive judges/funders and validating an idea in a broad, public audience.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>At around the same time in Barcelona (on June 13 \u2013 14), the BCN Music Hack Day hosted its 2013 competition. This annual event is held in conjunction with Sonar music festival and is part of a competition series that takes place in 9 cities around the world. 2013 has seen its largest number of competitors, with the event\u2019s 50 places snapped up ahead of time. 26 APIs were used in the competition, and 16 sponsors provided prizes. Winners included Festivalizr, which creates a music festival playlist using the <a href=\"http://www.programmableweb.com/api/deezer\">Deezer API</a>, and Hindify, which transforms any audio track into Hindustani music using the <a href=\"http://www.programmableweb.com/api/echo-nest\">Echonest API</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-55305\" src=\"http://blog.programmableweb.com/wp-content/mhd_2013_poster_small.jpg\" alt=\"BCN music hackathon poster\" width=\"342\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/UKandroid\">Grant Kemp</a> is one of the organizers of the meetup UK Hackathons and Jams, in London, where a Hacked event scheduled for 20-21 July was fully booked out in two weeks. \u201cTwo years ago, London had one event every 5 weeks or so,\u201d Mr Kemp said. \u201cNow there are several every weekend, and our meetup group has grown from 0 to 600 members in less than two years.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kemp credits some pop culture awareness for building knowledge of hackathons, but also sees the real-time learning focus, instant hacker community, and incubator environment as being key drivers.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cPeople see the Facebook movie and are interested in apps and what can be done, and are intrigued by the idea that new tools can be built overnight,\u201d Mr Kemp said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For some people who are very tech-y, the learning aspect and testing it out is the key focus. For example, I wanted to learn Android, so I attended a few hackathons and at the same time opened my eyes to other cool APIs like Twilio.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a real cross-pollination of ideas at hackathons and you get to share your ideas with other people and get feedback on it. There\u2019s also a larger number of people who come along with their ideas and who get to build something by meeting developers: It\u2019s a really good way to build networks and relationships. Happily, there have been some ideas that have been turned into business models off the back of this sort of work.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>Kemp also pointed to the growing infrastructure supporting API developers interested in hackathon competitiors: social networks and event sites like Lanyrd, Meetup, Hackerleague and ChallengePost.</p>\n<p>To keep up with growing demand, organizers are beginning to create competitions aimed at problem-solving for more specific needs (such as a forthcoming Californian hackathon aimed at helping the sustainable meat industry to scale up), or being hosted by an API service as part of a global competition series (as has been the case for the current Evernote Developer Cup).</p>\n<p>For API developers looking to test out ideas and build new

Chian Gong is one of four founders of HACKtivate ED, held in San Francisco from June 14 \u2013 16. Shortly after the event\u2019s announcement, HACKtivate ED booked out its full run of 80 places, but later extended the invitation to allow for another 20 participants. By the time the education-based hackathon was starting, a further 78 developers had been added to the waiting list. \n\n \n\n Speaking to ProgrammableWeb, Ms Chian Gong, an Education Pioneers Analyst Fellow at Aspire Public Schools, said: \n\n \n\n \n\n \u201cIn reading through applications for this event, we found a few themes that participants reiterated: \n\n\n\n \n\n There are a number of factors that contribute to this growing popularity. It feels like this generation of folks have really latched onto the idea of social impact and social entrepreneurship: an idea that innovation can help serve our communities. Similarly, the spirit of entrepreneurship is infectious in the Bay Area.  People are passionate about building things and scrappy development.  These hackathons offer an opportunity to challenge yourself, build something tangible, and meet similar like-minded folks  who might turn out to be your next co-founders! There\u2019s also of course some street cred and incentive to participate in a hackathon for the visibility of pitching to impressive judges/funders and validating an idea in a broad, public audience.\u201d \n\n \n\n \n\n At around the same time in Barcelona (on June 13 \u2013 14), the BCN Music Hack Day hosted its 2013 competition. This annual event is held in conjunction with Sonar music festival and is part of a competition series that takes place in 9 cities around the world. 2013 has seen its largest number of competitors, with the event\u2019s 50 places snapped up ahead of time. 26 APIs were used in the competition, and 16 sponsors provided prizes. Winners included Festivalizr, which creates a music festival playlist using the  Deezer API , and Hindify, which transforms any audio track into Hindustani music using the  Echonest API . \n\n\n\n \n\n  Grant Kemp  is one of the organizers of the meetup UK Hackathons and Jams, in London, where a Hacked event scheduled for 20-21 July was fully booked out in two weeks. \u201cTwo years ago, London had one event every 5 weeks or so,\u201d Mr Kemp said. \u201cNow there are several every weekend, and our meetup group has grown from 0 to 600 members in less than two years.\u201d \n\n \n\n Kemp credits some pop culture awareness for building knowledge of hackathons, but also sees the real-time learning focus, instant hacker community, and incubator environment as being key drivers. \n\n \n\n \n\n \u201cPeople see the Facebook movie and are interested in apps and what can be done, and are intrigued by the idea that new tools can be built overnight,\u201d Mr Kemp said. \n\n \n\n \u201cFor some people who are very tech-y, the learning aspect and testing it out is the key focus. For example, I wanted to learn Android, so I attended a few hackathons and at the same time opened my eyes to other cool APIs like Twilio. \n\n \n\n There\u2019s a real cross-pollination of ideas at hackathons and you get to share your ideas with other people and get feedback on it. There\u2019s also a larger number of people who come along with their ideas and who get to build something by meeting developers: It\u2019s a really good way to build networks and relationships. Happily, there have been some ideas that have been turned into business models off the back of this sort of work.\u201d \n\n \n\n \n\n Kemp also pointed to the growing infrastructure supporting API developers interested in hackathon competitiors: social networks and event sites like Lanyrd, Meetup, Hackerleague and ChallengePost. \n\n \n\n To keep up with growing demand, organizers are beginning to create competitions aimed at problem-solving for more specific needs (such as a forthcoming Californian hackathon aimed at helping the sustainable meat industry to scale up), or being hosted by an API service as part of a global competition series (as has been the case for the current Evernote Developer Cup). \n\n \n\n For API developers looking to test out ideas and build new business networks, getting a place at the competition table is the first battle to win. \n\n \n\n For more hackathon competition advice, check out our  Developer Evangelist Playbook series  with ChallengePost to provide key insights for developers considering entering API competitions and hackathons. \n\n\n\n"}, {"full_text_rss": 0, "media_id": 4506, "description": "<div> <div> <div> <p>Freespace is a experiment in civic hacking, inspired in no small part by Burning Man.

          \n\n \n\n Freespace is a experiment in civic hacking, inspired in no small part by Burning Man. But it\u2019s attracting the attention of Fortune 500 companies eager to find ways bring more creativity and innovation into their work spaces and companies. \n\n \n\n\n\n         \n\n Walk into the mural-covered 14,000-square-foot space in San Francisco\u2019s Central market district and you\u2019ll see a flurry of seemingly organized activity: people manning desks in the front, a day-by-day schedule scribbled in chalk on the wall, someone sweeping the floor, a family examining the makings of a slide (soon to be set up, but no one yet knows where) a cake being cut in the kitchen, and people tending the large garden out back. This isn\u2019t some quirky new startup: it\u2019s  Freespace , a monthlong experiment in civic hacking. \n\n \n\n Mike Zuckerman, the director of sustainability for the  Zen Compound , secured a $1 monthlong lease for June in the warehouse-like space, with a little help from  ReAllocate  and the Mayor\u2019s Office of Economic and Workforce Development. He didn\u2019t have specific agenda for the space, which was inspired by the  National Day of Civic Hacking  (June 1 and 2)--an event that asks participants to us technology to solve pressing civic issues. \n\n \n\n \"We put a weekend hackathon into a 30-day window,\" he says. \"It\u2019s up to people going inside to decide what happens.\" Instead, Zuckerman let news of Freespace spread by word of mouth, giving participants the opportunity to figure out what exactly it would look like. The first night it was open, hundreds of people came through. \n\n \n\n Everything in the space is donated or foraged: the couches, the desks, the refrigerator, everything  inside  the refrigerator (much of that has been donated by the Facebook Causes office), the aforementioned slide, the art, the gardening supplies, and even the giant 12th century Buddha sitting on the second floor, donated by  Christian Armstrong , the founder of the Buddha Preservation Foundation. \n\n \n\n The experiment has piqued the interest of people in the business world, including members of Deloittes Center for the Edge and Orange Telecom\u2019s labs in San Francisco. It\u2019s a way, Zuckerman says, to explain the Burning Man spirit of innovation to people who have never experienced it in person. And in fact, many of the main Freespace organizers come from the Burning Man community. \n\n \n\n \"[The business world] sees grassroots innovation and what it can look like. It\u2019s much easier to have a conversation with them about emerging trends in society and technology if it\u2019s an experiential thing,\" says Zuckerman. \"This type of thing that is emergent and free and has massively distributed creativity only because there\u2019s a container and a context is such an interesting message for corporate America.\" \n\n \n\n Leah Hunter, the AVP of of Insights and Innovation at innovation and design firm  Idea Couture , adds that she\u2019s been pointing Freespace out to her Fortune 500 clients \"to get them excited about the idea of experience design in a space as a social experiment.\" \n\n \n\n I can\u2019t tell you what you\u2019d find in Freespace today; it changes every day. But here are some of the things (and people) I saw when I visited on June 11th: \n\n\n\n   \n\n    Marc Roth , a formerly homeless  Tech Shop  instructor who was visiting the space with his family. Even before Freespace emerged, Roth had planned to create something called The Learning Shelter--a combination Tech Shop-like space and shelter centered in a 40-foot shipping container, built for the city\u2019s homeless population--in the Freespace parking lot. Roth doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll be able to get the Learning Shelter up and running in June, but he\u2019s grabbing onto the Freespace momentum. \"This might not be the timeframe in which I can accomplish this, but it\u2019s the time that Freespace is open,\" he says.  \n\n\n\n \n\n And then there were the  many activities  happening every day that I didn\u2019t get a chance to witness, including an infographic hackathon, yoga classes, a book club meeting, a book-making party, concerts, and a flower giveaway for the surrounding neighborhood. \n\n \n\n All of the things happening in Freespace are temporary, but the ultimate goal is for them to continue even when the 14,000 square foot incubation space is gone. \"It\u2019s a temporary space that creates lasting change for the community,\" says Hunter. \n\n \n\n While the Freespacers realize and mostly seem to accept the ephemeral nature of their experiment, they\u2019re still trying to keep it going with an  Indiegogo campaign   attempting to raise the $25,000 monthly rent required to extend Freespace into July. As Zuckerman explains, half of June was spent just getting the space set up, so an extra month could do wonders for the projects that are being incubated. \n\n \n\n The collective conversation in San Francisco these days tends to focus on the city\u2019s rapid gentrification--how high-paid tech workers are pricing everybody else out of the city, and how the city\u2019s creative spirit will get lost in the process. It\u2019s one version of a problem faced by gentrifying cities around the world. But that creative spirit isn\u2019t lost, at least as long as initiatives like Freespace continue to pop up. And they will. Freespace organizers are already in talks with other cities. \n\n     \n\n\n\n         Ariel Schwartz is a Senior Editor at Co.Exist.

One reason she decided to attend was her graduate education in public policy, nonprofit management, and community change: but she admits to having no background in computer science: \u201cI had spent some time grassroots organizing and advocating for public policy initiatives, so I was naturally drawn to the merging between technology and data and solving social issues,\u201d she writes. \n\n \n\n When asked about the most memorable experience of the hack-a-thon, Barnes wrote about the unique dynamic of the team: \u201cIt was a great experience working on a diverse team, comprised of men and women from many races and age groups, with varied skillsets and background, who were all passionate about tackling the same social issue. It is exciting to see the group continue to work together and build out the project; while the techies actually built the program, the team also includes members with experience on building out a social program.\u201d \n\n \n\n Pihl also remarked on their team's diversity as one of its strengths, in demographics as well as in skill sets. \u201cI was not going to go because I am not a techie,\u201d she writes. \u201cWhen I decided to participate I went into the weekend knowing that I would probably have to find a place of contribution. But, after I got over the fear of being a 'computer idiot' and letting the techies know it up-front, I felt it made room for me, in my own mind, to work from a place of confidence and not a place of fear. So mentally, I saw beyond being one of two women and the only black woman participating in the event. Because I embraced the fact that this was a competition that wanted everyone to contribute I felt confident to be participating.\u201d \n\n \n\n Aside from her day job as a regional development specialist with the  St. Louis County Economic Council , Pihl is also a social design advocate. She originally came to the hack-a-thon with a pitch for her own food waste reduction program concept, but ended up joining the Continuum team because it aligned with her experience working in housing accessibility. \n\n \n\n One moment that Pihl remembers most was meeting team member James Ware. Event organizer Jon Leek met Ware, a janitor in the building where the event was taking place, and invited him to speak with the Continuum team when he learned that Ware was once homeless and now spends his personal time helping the homeless. Ware soon became an integral part of the team. \u201cJames was the key to us finding a concrete idea to focus on,\u201d writes Pihl. \u201cWe probably spent over an hour discussing how we wanted to empower the homeless and couldn\u2019t grasp anything solid to start with, until James Ware\u2019s first-hand knowledge led us to how we could design technology to help and empower the homeless. The takeaway from this experience is that technology is only as good as the end user\u2019s feedback.\u201d \n\n \n\n The Continuum team will soon submit its project to the national level event for possible inclusion in a group of exceptional projects to be presented at the White House. If selected, the team will earn national recognition at the July event. \n\n\n\n     \n\n Erin Richey is a freelance journalist specializing in local business, tech security, and data journalism.

lot we can learn about today\u2019s explosion of social media from the rise of coffeehouse culture in London in the 1600s, according to Tom Standage in an opinion piece in yesterday\u2019s   New York Times  . Standage, the digital editor at  The Economist  and\u00a0 author \u00a0of the soon-to-be-released book \u201cWriting on the Wall:  Social Media  \u2014 The First 2,000 Years,\u201d has a point. When we complain of the collective time-wasting that is  Facebook     Facebook    and Twitter, we are actually echoing what Londoners said of the coffee houses in the 17th century. \n\n  \n\n And yet, Standage reminds us in that knowing way he learned at the  Economist , \u201cRather than enemies of industry, coffeehouses were in fact crucibles of creativity, because of the way in which they facilitated the mixing of both people and ideas.\u201d \u00a0And this was not just idle chatter. \u201cIt was a coffeehouse argument among several fellow scientists that spurred Isaac Newton to write his  Principia Mathematica ,\u201d Standage points out, \u201cone of the foundational works of modern science.\u201d \n\n  \n\n Modern markets and business had their origins among the coffee grounds as well. For merchants, coffeehouses were the co-working spaces of the day. \u201cA London coffeehouse called Jonathan\u2019s, where merchants kept particular tables at which they would transact their business,\u201d Standage writes,\u00a0\u201dturned into the  London Stock Exchange     London Stock Exchange   .\u201d And Edward Lloyd\u2019s coffeehouse, frequented by the nautical crowd, became the insurance giant Lloyd\u2019s of London. \n\n  \n\n Turning to the present day, Standage cites a  McKinsey study \u00a0that \u201cfound that the use of social networking within companies increased the productivity of \u2018knowledge workers\u2019 by 20 to 25 percent.\u201d This is all great stuff and I am in general in agreement with him that \u201cAs we grapple with the issues raised by new technologies, there is much we can learn from the past.\u201d \n\n  \n\n But something is crucially different here between what happend in England 350 years ago and what is happening on our digital networks today. That something is brought into focus by Jaron Lanier in his new book,   Who Owns The Future  . Our digital networks, the ones that constitute  Google     Google   , Facebook, Twitter and the rest, are asymmetrical in ways that undermine the conviviality of the coffeehouse and ultimately cause the economy to contract instead of grow. \n\n  \n\n This is a radical notion, but after reading Lanier\u2019s book and interviewing him, I believe he is right. Imagine if Newton\u2019s  Principia  was just \u201ccontent\u201d on a social network! And what if Lloyd\u2019s could be shut down because of a change in Facebook\u2019s policy? What if the only people making money in London in the 1650\u2032s were the sellers of the coffee? \n\n  \n\n I may be overstating this, but the point is that the great explosion of new businesses and business models, of new\u00a0scientific\u00a0theories and forms of public discourse that those coffeehouse engendered is not quite happening through our 21st century digital networks. Lanier made the damning point during our conversation that many venture capitalists \u201ctalk about shrinking markets as a criteria for investing in network-based business.\u201d He went on to say, \u201cIf the venture capitalists are saying that that\u2019s what they\u2019re looking for, that\u2019s a pretty good indication that that\u2019s what\u2019s going on in successful ventures.\u201d \n\n  \n\n Tim Worstall,  writing in these pages , decried Lanier\u2019s ideas as \u201csimply absurd.\u201d In response to the idea that digital networks are shrinking the economy he counters, \u201cjobs are a cost not a benefit of doing something.

\n\n Although the origins of the Internet go back over 50 years to DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) the consumer internet that we know, the World Wide Web, is less than 25 years old and didn\u2019t enter the public consciousness until the advent of the web browser 20 years ago. This history is relevant to\u00a0 Jaron Lanier \u2018s surprising assertion that the Internet is unique among mass technological innovations in  not  producing immediate and measurable economic benefit to the general public. \n\n  \n\n In a recent interview Lanier told me, \u201cwhen there\u2019s some new big piece of incredible infrastructure that makes the world more efficient, what happens afterwards is an expansion of opportunity and well-being for ordinary people. That happened with electricity and drinking water and interstates.\u2026 So here we are, over a decade into this transformation [with the internet] and we\u2019re seeing a different reality.\u201d \n\n  \n\n Lanier is not just talking about the Great Recession (although he sees hyper-networked finance as a direct cause), but about how the rise of top networks, or \u201csiren servers,\u201d has gone hand-in-hand with the growth of global income disparity. Our digital networks, Lanier argues, have hardwired a winner-take-all economy. \n\n  \n\n The example that got Lanier thinking about this is the first place is the music industry. He is best known as the inventor of virtual reality and as a computer scientist, but Lanier is also a musician. The \u201cliberation\u201d of the distribution of music made possible by the internet has turned working musicians into an underpaid underclass who can no longer count on royalties as the basis of a sustainable middle-class life. Lanier sees this same effect at work in all corners of the economy. \n\n  \n\n To counter the invisible hand of free market\u00a0proponents, like my colleague  Tim Worstall  of the Adam Smith Institute, Lanier says that today\u2019s creative destruction is more destructive than creative. \u201cEfficiency looks like market shrinkage,\u201d Lanier told me, \u201cyou have an incredible new business that concentrates wealth\u2026 but at the same time, there\u2019s a larger loss than the corresponding gain to the new venture. And that\u2019s clearly market shrinkage. If the venture capitalists are saying that that\u2019s what they\u2019re looking for, that\u2019s a pretty good indication that that\u2019s what\u2019s going on in successful ventures.\u201d \n\n  \n\n Silicon Valley VCs take great pleasure in not taking Lanier seriously. I think they are wrong. Although this\u00a0countervailing\u00a0\u201dnetwork effect\u201d is still\u00a0ambiguous\u00a0(and the subject of Lanier\u2019s ongoing \u201cresearch agenda\u201d) there are many indications that the shrinkage of the global middle class is related to the economic agenda of the large digital networks on the Internet. Lanier likens the situation to the emerging consensus about climate change. He has yet to prove causality, but quantitative evidence is pointing in that direction. \n\n  \n\n In Lanier\u2019s new book,   Who Owns the Future  , which I have referred to many times in recent posts, he argues that free content itself is to blame for this economic morass. The problem, he writes, is that too much of the underlying value of our digital networks (Google, Facebook, etc.) has been left off the books. Here is an example of an artist saying that the bean counters have not counted all of the beans! \n\n  \n\n What Lanier is recommending as a corrective is to  monetize everything  so that each individual creates material value through the use and contribution to these networks. This is a radical, and some might say unworkable, notion. But although the \u201chow to get there from here\u201d is far from clear (even to Lanier), the future he describes is one worth striving for. Lanier argues that two-way monetization will not only create more income parity, but will lead to a larger overall economy. \n\n  \n\n I will let the economists duke this one out\u00a0quantitatively, but as a content person, there is a lot of appeal to Lanier\u2019s idea. My conversation with him was far reaching and attempted to get at where we go from here. That his answers are provisional and speculative points to the experimental nature of paradigm shifts. Lanier is both an artist and a scientist, but not a dogmatic theorist. He sees himself as taking the lead but not ultimately the one to figure this all out. Properly monetized, he shouldn\u2019t have any problem finding help. \n\n \n\n \n\n  AK   I was a big fan of [your last book]  You Are Not A Gadget . It made sense of a whole lot of stuff for me. I\u2019m pretty convinced by your argument in  Who Owns The Future , but I do wonder what is the evidence that digital networks are actually contracting the economy?  \n\n  \n\n  JL  As I say in the book, there\u2019s a kind of a characteristic ambiguity about patterns that are perceived in a complex system, and the metaphor I draw is to global climate change and the debate about, first, whether it exists at all, and second, whether people are causing it. And I think there are some analogies to be made here. \n\n  \n\n We can start with the broad observation, which is what motivated me to go down this road at all, which is that normally, when there\u2019s some new big piece of incredible infrastructure that makes the world more efficient, what happens afterwards is an expansion of opportunity and well-being for ordinary people. That happened with electricity and drinking water and interstates. Maybe not absolutely, not instantly, but it did happen in an observable way that was overwhelmingly clear within a few years, or even a decade. So here we are, over a decade into this transformation and we\u2019re seeing a different reality. \n\n  \n\n Now, that doesn\u2019t prove causality. As I say in the book, one could say that the internet\u2019s helping, but not enough, or all sorts of things. At any rate, we\u2019re not seeing the effects that I was certainly expecting for decades before, with tremendous anticipation. But then, if we want to look at it in more detail, there are a few different places we can look. One is just in the strategies explicitly laid out by the people who fund internet businesses. And I\u2019ve really been struck by how many talk about shrinking markets as a criteria for investing\u00a0 in network-based business. \n\n  \n\n I think what\u2019s happened is there\u2019s been a realization that efficiency looks like market shrinkage, that you have an incredible new business that concentrates wealth (to use the language of the left) or is very profitable, but at the same time, there\u2019s a larger loss than the corresponding gain to the new venture. And that\u2019s clearly market shrinkage. If the venture capitalists are saying that that\u2019s what they\u2019re looking for, that\u2019s a pretty good indication that that\u2019s what\u2019s going on in successful ventures. \n\n\n\n                     Why Social Media Isn't Doing For Us What London's Coffee Houses Did For 17th Century\n\n                     Is Civic Hacking The Future Of Democracy And Job Creation?\n\n                     Douglas Rushkoff's Present Shock: The End Of Time Is Not The End Of The World\n\n"}, {"full_text_rss": 0, "media_id": 5927, "description": "<p><img align=\"right\" size-full wp-image-58768\" title=\"CivOmega\" src=\"http://blog.programmableweb.com/wp-content/Picture-15.png\" alt=\"CivOmega\" width=\"162\" height=\"44\" />Developers are being invited to share their <a href=\"http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/10/01/why-open-data-apis-may-revolutionize-business-and-the-web/\">Open Data APIs</a> with <a href=\"http://civomega.com\">CivOmega</a> to help drive the capacity of a natural language search engine.</p>\n<p>CivOmega was created by Dan Schultz and colleagues as part of an entry in the recent Knight-Mozilla Open News Hack Day event.

The details are documented in the ReadMe, but the general idea is that if you have an API and you can think of example questions that your API knows how to deal with, you just need to write a little module that will be able to say to the system \u2018hey, I know how to answer that!\u2019 and issue a pull request with your code to the CivOmega repository.\u201d \n\n \n\n \n\n For API developers wanting to promote their open data repository, when search results are displayed in CivOmega, a link is provided back to the original data source. Currently, data is sourced from the Sunlight Foundation, United States Census Bureau and the White House. \n\n \n\n Dan Schulz explains that at present there is a payoff between having more opendata in the backend fuelling the answers and being able to decipher questions in the frontend to determine the best way to respond: \n\n \n\n \n\n \u201cTake a look at the modules that have been written so far to see how questions are being answered now.  It isn\u2019t necessarily beautiful yet, but at least it works.  We\u2019re going to be making this a more streamlined and powerful process eventually, but we can\u2019t wait for that to keep growing the project!\u201d \n\n \n\n \n\n Developers who want to contribute to the tool beyond plugging in their open data APIs are welcome to make contact. Some additional tasks have already been identified as requiring further developer input, including providing a JavaScript SDK and building a library of parsers to work with open APIs. \n\n\n\n"},

While the group is based in Chicago, the idea is that any city can grab code from an Open City app and make it their own. \n\n \n\n Here are a few interesting examples:\u00a0 Clear Streets  tracks a city\u2019s plows in real time. Living outside of Boston, I know we could use an app like that! \u00a0 Crime in Chicago  lets citizens compare crime statistics in certain areas of town, which could be useful for people making decisions about where to move their families. \n\n \n\n What\u2019s perhaps the most gratifying is that as open-source developers, we can collaborate on projects and help people around the world. It\u2019s part of what gets us out of bed in the morning. Earlier this year, participants in DrupalCon Portland  launched a website  in 24 hours to help people in Moore, Okla., find transportation and housing after the tornado. Two weeks later, the site was discovered on Twitter in Germany and was repurposed to help people affected by the flooding in northern Europe. This type of project inspires us all to see how technology can make an immediate difference. \n\n \n\n Other events, such as the  National Day for Civic Hacking , encourage developers to use open government data to \u201ccollaboratively create, build, and invent.\u201d The idea that hackathons can help build and create a healthy, citizen-powered technology ecosystem within government is relatively new, and full of promise. Tim O\u2019Reilly believes that government can escape the \u201cvending machine\u201d mentality (citizens put in tax dollars and get out services) by thinking of \u201c Government as a Platform \u201d for participation. I couldn\u2019t agree more. \n\n \n\n Open source ideals are already spreading in governments throughout the world, with good reason. A global network of developers is motivated to help. It\u2019s one of the best examples of civic engagement. As digital citizens, we all now have the power to contribute. One person\u2019s time and talent can make a huge difference. That\u2019s a movement I\u2019m proud to be a part of. \n\n\n\n \t\n\n \n\n About VentureBeat \n\n\n\n VentureBeat provides news about innovation for forward-thinking executives. It covers a range of technology trends, from social media to mobile, clean technology, games and chips. We try to explain what these trends mean for business leaders, executives and other thought leaders in the industry. Stories help executives make better decisions regarding technology in both small businesses and enterprise, and help investors make better decisions about where to put their money. VentureBeat is engagingly written, not only profiling the companies behind innovation, but also the leading individual players setting those trends. Some of the companies it covers in depth include Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Twitter, Zynga, Cisco, RIM, but it also covers pathbreaking start-up companies. \n\n  \n\n\t \n\n\n\n"}, {"full_text_rss": 0, "media_id": 5652, "description": "<div id=\"attachment_82023\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\" style=\"width: 596px\"><a href=\"http://tedconfblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/kasimreed.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-82023 \" alt=\"&quot;Cities are where hope meets the street, y'all.&quot; Atlanta mayor, Kasim Reed, speaking at TEDCity2.0.

That was the question posed by urban planner and Berkeley professor <a href=\"http://www.ced.berkeley.edu/faculty/roy_ananya/\">Ananya Roy</a> as she kicked off the day. Creating one, complete with shimmering towers of glass and steel is a fervent quest of city planners around the world&#8230; and yet, she argues, it&#8217;s entirely the wrong focus. Instead, we need to celebrate and embrace the invisible majority \u00a0so often ignored or overlooked in the quest for &#8220;world-class&#8221; status.</p>\r\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.iftiinfoundation.com/about-us-3/people/\">Mohamed Ali</a>&#8216;s\u00a0hometown of Mogadishu, Somalia, 70% of young people are unemployed. They have nothing to do, and they grasp opportunities wherever they arise. Sometimes, those opportunities come from less-than-savory sources. Terrorist groups, for instance. Instead, we need to think about inspiring young people to be entrepreneurs. That, he argued, is how we can &#8220;empower young people to be creators of the economic opportunity they are so desperately seeking.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a teacher and practitioner of civics in America,&#8221;\u00a0<a href=\"http://ericliu.com/\">Eric Liu</a>\u00a0announced as he walked on stage. Then he asked us all to wake up. It was a dark joke&#8230; it turns out, our lack of care or thought for the mechanics of civics have insidious effects. &#8220;Those who do understand how power works, how a bias becomes a policy, how friendship becomes a subsidy or a slogan becomes a movement wield disproportionate influence and are happy to fill vacuum of ignorance of the great majority,&#8221; he argued. We must bypass these monopolies of control, and use cities as a laboratory for experimentation and innovation.</p>\r\n<p>As many as 99%\u00a0of women experience street harassment at some point in their lives.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.ihollaback.org/about/who-we-are/\">Emily May</a>\u00a0certainly has, and she took the stage to talk about Hollaback, a\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.thecity2.org/stories/emily-may-wants-you-to-hollaback\">TED City 2.0 Prize</a>-winning program to help solve the problem that now operates in\u00a065 cities in 22 countries. &#8220;Together we tell the story of a global epidemic,&#8221; said May as she urged the audience to take action and get involved. &#8220;We\u2019re fierce, we\u2019re loving and we\u2019re coming to a town near you.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>&#8220;Cities are where hope meets the street, y&#8217;all,&#8221; said Atlanta Mayor\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.atlantaga.gov/index.aspx?page=16\">Kasim Reed</a>\u00a0as he took the stage. He shared a charming story of meeting with a constituent when he was running for office. His pitch fell flat; she didn&#8217;t care about his shiny airport, fancy restaurants or the presence of Fortune 500 companies in the city. She cared about the derelict recreation center near her house. She cared about young people scaring her if she left the house. And she cared about being worried about taking a bus at night. Reed shared the way he&#8217;s approached redefining Atlanta and described how he took\u00a0the lessons to heart.\u00a0&#8221;She helped to make a mayor and she changed a city,&#8221; he concluded.</p>\r\n<p>Urban freestyling on the TED stage, you say? That&#8217;s right. <a href=\"http://bklynbeast.com/about-us/our-team/\">Bklyn Beast</a> came along to jump, literally, all over the TED stage with extraordinary energy and athleticism that inspired whoops from the audience and baffled confusion from your correspondent.</p>\r\n<p>A break for caffeine and snacks and then we&#8217;re right back at it.\u00a0\u201cThe worst idea we\u2019ve ever had is suburban sprawl,\u201d said\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.jeffspeck.com/\">Jeff Speck</a>, who came on stage to champion the idea of the walkable city. He shared the impacts within cities that had successfully adopted walkable principles and excoriated the car, lyrically describing it as a &#8220;gas-belching, time-wasting, life-threatening prosthetic device.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://soundslikesweeney.com/\">Jason Sweeney</a> suffers from\u00a0vertigo, dizziness, tinnitus and frequent panic attacks, conditions he shared with us as he took the stage. You can feel the audience reach out to buoy him up. But these unnerving experiences are also the reason he focuses on finding quiet spaces within cities such as the one in which he makes his home, Adelaide, Australia. He shared his\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.thecity2.org/stories/emily-may-wants-you-to-hollaback\">TED City 2.0 Prize</a>-winning project, <a href=\"http://www.stereopublic.net/\">Stereopublic</a>, and even challenged the TED audience to be quiet for 30 seconds. It&#8217;s really startling what you hear when you stop to listen.</p>\r\n<p>Benjamin Franklin as hacker? What? That&#8217;s the case Catherine Bracy made as she described the influence the founding father has had on <a href=\"http://www.codeforamerica.org/\">Code for America</a>, the organization that champions civic hacking in cities. Describing wonderful moments of civic hacking in cities from Honolulu to Mexico City, she makes the case that regular people can do more than protest or sign a petition to make an impact. Even if you have no programming experience at all, you can still get involved. <a href=\"http://brigade.codeforamerica.org\">&#8220;Hack with us,&#8221;</a> she concluded. Inspiring.</p>\r\n<p>From the moment retired political science professor Dennis Dalton\u00a0joined the faculty of Columbia university in 1969, he was keenly aware of the &#8220;wall of separation between the town and the gown.&#8221; But in 1993 he spotted &#8220;a crack in the Ivy League wall&#8221; when three local Harlem residents began to audit his class. It was, he described, a revelation, as all involved were newly exposed to different experiences and ideas. The surprise for this audience: when it turned out that all three of those class auditors were in the room. They stood, to great applause.</p>\r\n<p>&#8220;Writer, teacher, technophile and pop culture enthusiast&#8221;\u00a0<a href=\"http://felicebelle.com/\">Felice Bell</a> concluded the second session of the day, reciting a beautiful, lyrical paean to the city and its residents,\u00a0&#8221;the nurses, the morticians, the drummer, the front man, the unemployed, the unseen price tags on individual life.&#8221;</p>\r\n<br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/tedconfblog.wordpress.com/82008/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\"

That was the question posed by urban planner and Berkeley professor   Ananya Roy   as she kicked off the day. Creating one, complete with shimmering towers of glass and steel is a fervent quest of city planners around the world\u2026 and yet, she argues, it\u2019s entirely the wrong focus. Instead, we need to celebrate and embrace the invisible majority \u00a0so often ignored or overlooked in the quest for \u201cworld-class\u201d status. \n\n \n\n In   Mohamed Ali  \u2018s\u00a0hometown of Mogadishu, Somalia, 70% of young people are unemployed. They have nothing to do, and they grasp opportunities wherever they arise. Sometimes, those opportunities come from less-than-savory sources. Terrorist groups, for instance. Instead, we need to think about inspiring young people to be entrepreneurs. That, he argued, is how we can \u201cempower young people to be creators of the economic opportunity they are so desperately seeking.\u201d \n\n \n\n \u201cI\u2019m a teacher and practitioner of civics in America,\u201d\u00a0  Eric Liu  \u00a0announced as he walked on stage. Then he asked us all to wake up. It was a dark joke\u2026 it turns out, our lack of care or thought for the mechanics of civics have insidious effects. \u201cThose who do understand how power works, how a bias becomes a policy, how friendship becomes a subsidy or a slogan becomes a movement wield disproportionate influence and are happy to fill vacuum of ignorance of the great majority,\u201d he argued. We must bypass these monopolies of control, and use cities as a laboratory for experimentation and innovation. \n\n \n\n As many as 99%\u00a0of women experience street harassment at some point in their lives.\u00a0  Emily May  \u00a0certainly has, and she took the stage to talk about Hollaback, a\u00a0 TED City 2.0 Prize -winning program to help solve the problem that now operates in\u00a065 cities in 22 countries. \u201cTogether we tell the story of a global epidemic,\u201d said May as she urged the audience to take action and get involved. \u201cWe\u2019re fierce, we\u2019re loving and we\u2019re coming to a town near you.\u201d \n\n \n\n \u201cCities are where hope meets the street, y\u2019all,\u201d said Atlanta Mayor\u00a0  Kasim Reed  \u00a0as he took the stage. He shared a charming story of meeting with a constituent when he was running for office. His pitch fell flat; she didn\u2019t care about his shiny airport, fancy restaurants or the presence of Fortune 500 companies in the city. She cared about the derelict recreation center near her house. She cared about young people scaring her if she left the house. And she cared about being worried about taking a bus at night. Reed shared the way he\u2019s approached redefining Atlanta and described how he took\u00a0the lessons to heart.\u00a0\u201dShe helped to make a mayor and she changed a city,\u201d he concluded. \n\n \n\n At the start of the day, co-host Chris Anderson asked his mighty twitter army to tell him: What do you love about your city? He jumps onstage now to read some answers: \n\n \n\n \n\n @ TEDchris  I love Krakow even more because finally we have good coffee. Now we just need a sensible bike lane policy\u2026\u2014  \u00a0 (@cracovianka)  September 20, 2013  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n @ TEDchris  I love  #Boston .

That\u2019s right.   Bklyn Beast   came along to jump, literally, all over the TED stage with extraordinary energy and athleticism that inspired whoops from the audience and baffled confusion from your correspondent. \n\n \n\n A break for caffeine and snacks and then we\u2019re right back at it.\u00a0\u201cThe worst idea we\u2019ve ever had is suburban sprawl,\u201d said\u00a0  Jeff Speck  , who came on stage to champion the idea of the walkable city. He shared the impacts within cities that had successfully adopted walkable principles and excoriated the car, lyrically describing it as a \u201cgas-belching, time-wasting, life-threatening prosthetic device.\u201d \n\n \n\n   Jason Sweeney   suffers from\u00a0vertigo, dizziness, tinnitus and frequent panic attacks, conditions he shared with us as he took the stage. You can feel the audience reach out to buoy him up. But these unnerving experiences are also the reason he focuses on finding quiet spaces within cities such as the one in which he makes his home, Adelaide, Australia. He shared his\u00a0 TED City 2.0 Prize -winning project,  Stereopublic , and even challenged the TED audience to be quiet for 30 seconds. It\u2019s really startling what you hear when you stop to listen. \n\n \n\n Benjamin Franklin as hacker? What? That\u2019s the case Catherine Bracy made as she described the influence the founding father has had on   Code for America  , the organization that champions civic hacking in cities. Describing wonderful moments of civic hacking in cities from Honolulu to Mexico City, she makes the case that regular people can do more than protest or sign a petition to make an impact. Even if you have no programming experience at all, you can still get involved.  \u201cHack with us,\u201d  she concluded. Inspiring. \n\n \n\n From the moment retired political science professor Dennis Dalton\u00a0joined the faculty of Columbia university in 1969, he was keenly aware of the \u201cwall of separation between the town and the gown.\u201d But in 1993 he spotted \u201ca crack in the Ivy League wall\u201d when three local Harlem residents began to audit his class. It was, he described, a revelation, as all involved were newly exposed to different experiences and ideas. The surprise for this audience: when it turned out that all three of those class auditors were in the room. They stood, to great applause. \n\n \n\n \u201cWriter, teacher, technophile and pop culture enthusiast\u201d\u00a0  Felice Bell   concluded the second session of the day, reciting a beautiful, lyrical paean to the city and its residents,\u00a0\u201dthe nurses, the morticians, the drummer, the front man, the unemployed, the unseen price tags on individual life.\u201d \n\n\n\n \t\n\n By Courtney E.

C\u00edvico: Civic-Minded Techies Gain Sway with Government in Mexico and Beyond\n\n \n\n To many in Mexico, what became known as the \"millionaire's app\" was just the latest in an old story of bloated state spending; but Soto and his colleagues saw a chance to push a new approach instead. In two days, they'd covered their white office walls with ideas for a cheaper alternative and launched an online  contest  that drew input from more than 150 software developers and designers, producing five open-source options in two weeks. \n\n \n\n Lawmakers soon  insisted  they'd never known about the original app, which had been quietly approved by a legislative administrative board; and a congressional spokesman  rushed to clarify  that the project had been suspended. Invited to pitch their  alternatives  to Congress, a half-dozen young coders took the podium in a sloping auditorium at the legislature. The only cost for their work: a 11,500-peso (then US $930) prize for the winner. \n\n \n\n \"We didn't just 'angry tweet,' we actually did something,\" Soto, a 28-year-old IT engineer and social entrepreneur, said at the time. \"Citizens need to understand democracy beyond voting every few years, and government needs to understand that we're willing to participate.\" \n\n \n\n Seven months later, Mexico's president appears to have heard them, hiring Soto and nine others to launch one of the world's first federal civic innovation offices, part of a broader national digital agenda to be formally unveiled today. Building on a model pioneered in a handful of U.S. cities since 2010, Mexico's civic innovation team aims to integrate so-called \"civic hackers\" with policy experts already inside government -- to not only build better technology, but to seed a more tech-minded approach to problem-solving across federal processes and policy. What began as outside activism is slowly starting to creep into government. \n\n \n\n Long considered a dry topic by many citizens, government IT has popped to life in recent headlines, with news of the NSA's vast surveillance machine on one hand highlighting the United States' imposing tech prowess, even as its botched launch of HealthCare.gov exposes severe problems in the way that government buys and builds software. That paradox echoes around the globe: While governments may spend heavily on high-tech intelligence and security programs, most are still struggling to update the unwieldy IT systems that run almost everything else. \n\n \n\n Mexico's app incident reflects a common problem in that process: wasteful spending by non-techie bureaucrats who don't seem to know what they're buying -- at best, out-of-touch; at worst, party to crony contracting; and overseen, if at all, by officials even less tech-savvy than themselves. Citizens, in contrast, are adopting new technologies faster than much of the public sector, growing the gap between the efficiency and accountability that they expect as private consumers, and the bureaucratic, buggy experience that government still provides. \n\n \n\n To break that cycle, a movement of community-minded \"civic hackers\" like Soto has stepped into the void, offering their own low-cost tools to make government more efficient, collaborative and transparent. In recent years, thousands of developers and designers have met to build civic-aimed software at weekend hackathons or casual coding nights across the  U.S.  and  Europe ; and similar networks are now cropping up across Latin America, Africa and Asia - part of a twin push for more democratic and more digital societies. Latin America's increasingly stable, middle-class democracies, including Mexico, Chile and Brazil, have seen a particular surge in events like  Desarrollando America Latina ,  Campus Party  and  ABRE LATAM , which convene coders to address issues including crime, education, pollution and public health. For-profit brands sponsor contests like Brazilian mobile-phone provider Vivo's  Smart City  challenge, and philanthropies including the Avina Foundation have  called  for tech projects that boost civic participation. The resulting apps have done things like map crime to spot trends, let parents rate and compare schools, and help citizens recycle, report pollution or avoid traffic. \n\n \n\n Their efforts illustrate an alternate definition of the term \"hacker\" that's common in tech circles: not a sinister saboteur, but a problem-solving programmer who finds creative ways around obstacles. Skipping slow social-science research and long product cycles, civic hackers favor an action-oriented, agile approach to software development that allows them to build, release and continuously refine their work. And because they believe in using open-source code -- free, public and infinitely alterable -- their output isn't meant to be final, but perfected over time by the community; not to mention retooled for use by other public offices, potentially saving millions now spent on redundant projects across jurisdictions. \n\n\n\n \n\n Most civic hacking still takes form as outside activism, using the power of example to show officials and citizens how government might change its approach to technology. Around the world, some agencies are starting to pay attention -- not only accepting civic hacking as a new avenue of citizen engagement, but as a potential source of new tools. Many public offices now hold their own hackathons, including the  White House , which in June hosted one of nearly 100 events marking the first \" National Day of Civic Hacking \" in the U.S. Since Washington D.C. launched its initial  Apps for Democracy  contest in 2008, similar events have mushroomed in big and small cities across the U.S.; federally, they've spread from  NASA  and the Department of  Health and Human Services  to the  Environmental Protection Agency ,  Labor Department , and  Veterans' Affairs  - in part through  Challenge.gov , a platform designed to help government agencies host innovation contests to tap the public for new ideas. The State Department, well-known for its paradigm-shifting approach to \" 21st century statecraft ,\" including digital training camps for global NGOs and public diplomacy through social media, is also reaching out to civic hackers through coding contests, for example with  USAID 's 2012 \" Hack for Hunger \" and a joint U.S./Russia  codeathon  that saw programmers in D.C. and Moscow build tools to track crime, legislation, and public contracts in 2011. \n\n \n\n Globally, the World Bank has played a catalyzing role, not only hosting worldwide  water - and  sanitation -themed contests, but seeding the model in Latin America specifically, for example coordinating infrastructure and health-themed hackathons in  Colombia , a challenge to fight domestic violence in  Central America , and key  events  around disaster relief -- even using winning apps to locate missing people after 2010 earthquakes in Haiti and Chile. Government agencies in  Brazil  and  Chile  have held their own national app contests, including a  hackathon  launched by Brazil's congress last month to source legislative transparency tools in the wake of anti-government protests earlier this year. In Mexico, the national tax agency this summer asked Soto and his colleagues to run an  open call  for an app to improve tax collection and service; while cities from  Buenos Aires  to  Rio de Janeiro  to  Mexico City  have convened coders at a host of more general local contests, too. \n\n \n\n Still, hackathons have limitations: Given their experimental, brainstorm-and-build-it nature, they produce more focused prototypes than systemic proposals -- drawing fire for spreading the \"solutionist\" illusion that cool apps can cure complex governance problems. In the rush to build something, coders can often fail to understand or address the context and roots of problems at hand; and without input from policy experts who've spent years studying complex issues like poverty, education or crime, they can end up producing simplistic or flashy tools that are divorced from real needs. That gap can be especially acute in emerging economies: an app to report potholes, for example, may be of little value in a place where roads aren't paved or few people own smartphones or cars. \n\n \n\n Yet the speed, small scale, and low cost with which hackers build things can also slash the stakes for failure, freeing government to try new ways of delivering services and engaging citizens, reshaping its attitude toward risk and innovation. \"An iPhone app isn't going to change structural problems in democracy,\" so civic hackers often focus on improving basic public services instead, said David Sasaki, an expert in open government and technology for the Omidyar Network in Latin America. It's not always about the actual apps built as much as it's about showing what's possible: \"It's highly symbolic,\" Sasaki said. \"It's about changing the mentality within government.\"  \n\n \n\n Civic hackathons can change the mentality outside government, too, creating new communities of techies who may've never thought about public service, but now find it full of interesting challenges. In that, civic hacking is part of a broader, emerging \"civic tech\" movement, which draws on crowdsourcing principles of community-based problem-solving. It can be seen as the latest incarnation of digital democracy: If \"e-government\" started to push public services online in the late 1990s, and \"e-participation\" engaged voters and officials in a more direct dialogue in the 2000s, civic tech is now moving from communication to collaboration, recruiting citizens not only to advocate but to build alternative solutions. While David Cameron's \" Big Society \" program in part sought such collaboration as way to cut public spending in the U.K., U.S. and Latin American officials seem intent on using it to source new ideas. \n\n \n\n  Innovation Infrastructure  \n\n \n\n To institutionalize that input, cities from  Boston  and Philadelphia to Buenos Aires and Mexico City are building an innovation infrastructure, opening civic tech offices that often partner with the community to identify, build and test new approaches -- not only working with civic hackers, but sometimes hiring them into permanent roles. Fellowship programs can seem a safe way to start: Nonprofit Code for America has joined with dozens of U.S. cities since 2011, sending tech teams into town on one-year fellowships to devise and disseminate easy-to-use tools, in the process training a new crop of civic hackers who could make careers in the public sector. Code for America founder Jen Pahlka, now a deputy U.S. CTO, coordinates a Presidential Innovation Fellowship, which draws developers and entrepreneurs to tackle specific projects across the federal government. Her organization has meanwhile helped to spread the model internationally,  working with  Mexico City's new  Laboratorio para la Ciudad  to launch a local fellowship last May. A division of Jamaica's Agriculture Ministry did the same, partnering with the regional program  Code for the Caribbean ; and Buenos Aires consulted with Code for America when  staffing up  its own  civic innovation lab  to incubate projects hatched at local hackathons. \n\n \n\n In contrast to the broader innovation offices that some governments are opening to promote economic growth through traditional tech entrepreneurship, these specifically \"civic\" innovation offices are the first to focus explicitly on the relationship between technology, citizen engagement, and public services. Soto's team, for example, is part of a larger presidential office on national digital strategy, Mexico's first, which also includes groups dedicated to e-government and digital communication. Founder and coordinator Alejandra Lagunes, a former Google Mexico director who ran President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto's digital campaign in 2012, brought the idea into the administration, which promised in a key inaugural  agreement  to implement the country's first open-data and e-government strategy, betting that a more transparent and efficient government would boost economic growth and investment, too. \n\n \n\n Yet some experts warn that having separate innovation offices can risk siloing change, when what really spreads new ideas throughout government are direct personal relationships across agencies, an April  study  by the New America Foundation's California Civic Innovation Project found. Many civic innovation teams also focus on finding new forms of public engagement, when a more lasting transformation may require rebuilding internal tools and processes instead. But that's a tall order: Software built by small experimental offices or volunteer techies will never be as complex or secure as would be needed for a massive government project like HealthCare.gov. And even if civic hackers had access to resources for such complicated work, they'd face an uphill battle navigating the arcane procurement systems that can prevent governments from using small vendors or volunteer labor. \n\n \n\n That's why for Soto, it's about striking a balance: bringing civic hackers onto teams with issue experts across government to address specific needs, demonstrating a new approach as well as its impact, which may in time be more likely to change process and policy. \"We could never build a HealthCare.gov with a hackathon. But with the office we're building, that's exactly the point: to create high-impact projects that lead to something more,\" he said this month from his new desk in Mexico City's leafy Condesa neighborhood. \"Success isn't launching 120 apps. Success is actually changing a process inside government forever,\" so that the next HealthCare.gov-like debacle never happens. \n\n \n\n  Open Data  \n\n \n\n That shift will require sharing not just best practices, but data, across government. For that reason, Mexico's civic innovation team is drafting a national open data policy and building an open data  portal , pushing federal and state offices to share information across jurisdictions, as well as with citizens. Though a founding member of the global  Open Government Partnership , Mexico has been slow to issue open data regulations; even now, Soto's team is taking a gradual approach, polling members of the public to see what kind of information they want to see made available first, rather than releasing thousands of datasets unprompted. \n\n \n\n Open data, and the belief that troves of government information should be accessible to citizens, is in fact key to the civic tech movement. From budget and fundraising figures, to the census, transit, or public safety stats that coders use to build apps mapping traffic and crime, public data are the building blocks of civic tech: More than transparency for transparency's sake, they allow citizens to build tools that can not only hold government accountable, but make it more efficient. Since the U.S. enacted its milestone Freedom of Information Act in 1966, watchdog groups like the D.C.-based Sunlight Foundation have modernized the push for open government, crafting new roles for the public in mining information once it's released. A key argument is economic: give citizens access to data, and they can build businesses around it, just as weather and GPS industries blossomed after federal satellite data were released. A 2013  White House Executive Order  promotes that kind of collaboration, making federal data open by default specifically so entrepreneurs can build businesses around it. To an extent, that link between open data and economic growth can give advocates and officials a common cause. \n\n \n\n Yet transparency groups and governments have had a different and arguably more antagonistic relationship in Latin America than in the U.S. Born amid the wave of democratizations that swept the region in the 1980s and 1990s, local transparency efforts at first focused on exposing human rights abuses by recent military governments -- a tough task that often left each side slower to trust the other, complicating efforts to work together on new issues. Some transparency groups have embraced a broader purpose, though, with organizations like Mexico's  Fundar  and Chile's  Cuidadano Inteligente  not only pressing for a wider range of data to be released, but recruiting techies to make sense of that data and put it to wider use. In that, civic hackers may help to further align interests: on one hand, they transform jumbled information into new tools for activists to hold governments accountable; on the other, they translate it into usable data sets for citizens, businesses, and even governments --essentially recognizing that transparency is not just about truth, but performance. \n\n \n\n \"Open data combats what are probably our two biggest problems: corruption and inefficiency,\" said Rodrigo Gallegos, director of sustainability and technology at the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness, a Mexico City think tank. \"Governments learn a lot when they open data and society is able to manipulate it in a creative way to find solutions or patterns. There's a huge opportunity.\" \n\n \n\n  Digital Divide  \n\n \n\n To realize that potential, though, Latin America's civic tech infrastructure needs to grow -- a question of resources as much as of interest. A gaping digital divide still limits the degree to which technology can be an avenue of civic participation, just as it limits the degree to which tech can drive economic growth. Mexico, for example, is home to one of the region's biggest tech sectors, but just 38 percent of people have Internet access, according to the  U.N ; and though mobile penetration neared 87 percent last year, high service costs have at times made civil society reluctant to use text messaging to engage citizens, a 2011  report  for the D.C.-based New Policy Institute found. \n\n \n\n Still, infrastructure investments are narrowing the gap; and telecom reforms are expected to boost competition and slash prices, increasing digital participation. The Mexican president's new digital agenda broadly aims to close the divide and put technology to new use in public safety, education and healthcare, investing in growing a digital economy. Latin America in general is already home to some of the world's most avid social media users, with Brazil and Mexico respectively boasting the world's fourth- and fifth-biggest groups of active  Twitter users  last year, and third- and fifth-biggest groups of  Facebook users  - many of whom put those platforms to civic use. In one early example, Mexicans tweeting around the 2009 #InternetNecesario campaign drew enough attention to kill a proposed 3 percent luxury tax on internet fees; today, many don't just use Twitter to lobby government, but to fill in where it has failed them, for example creating city-specific hashtags to warn one another of shootings and drug violence in places where cartel threats can deter police and journalists -- a trend  explored  by Microsoft Research. \n\n \n\n Long before they were invited into government, Mexican civic techies built specific mobile tools to transmit everything from top-down hurricane alerts; to two-way crime reports based on citizen tips; to bottom-up election-monitoring tips, with voters submitting cases of suspected fraud. One key platform, Cuidemos el Voto (\"Protect the Vote\"), drew so many tips during Mexico's 2009 congressional race that the federal electoral crime office asked to use it, said co-founder Oscar Salazar, a startup veteran who worked with Soto in 2011 to launch Citivox, a dashboard that aggregates citizens' digital complaints. In the beginning, \"it's about creating apps where citizens can engage as a community, improve their lives and gather a critical mass, so that government starts realizing something is happening. Then government engages,\" Salazar said. \n\n \n\n As those efforts start to fuel demand for civic tech, governments can help to fuel supply by growing the pool of qualified coders. Though its public IT investments  sharply lag  stated goals, Mexico has still  sent  billions of pesos (hundreds of millions of dollars) to foster local software and ICT clusters and counts some 600,000 IT employees, with more than that number of  students enrolled  in engineering and technology programs. The question remains, though, how many among this new generation of techies will trade time at an IT giant or in the region's budding startup scene to work on civic projects. \"We don't have a lack of talent; it's just focused on a different set of problems - they're trying to build for the consumer web, to build the next Twitter or Facebook, instead of looking out the window and seeing the real problems we have,\" said Rodolfo Wilhelmy, one of the hackers behind Mexico's \"millionaire's app\" contest, who now works with Soto as director of open data for the president's civic innovation team. \n\n \n\n  Codeando Mexico  \n\n \n\n Wilhelmy should know: Three years ago, he'd never heard of civic tech. Then a 25-year-old IT grad from the prestigious Tecnologico de Monterrey, he'd been building iPhone and Blackberry apps for his own startup and another local venture, cranking out everything from newsreader and e-commerce software to a Foursquare/Facebook mashup that helped people find the nearest taco stand. \"After a while, I just said to myself, 'What am I doing - writing software for a brand, or should I work on something of real impact?'\" he recalled. When friends asked him to join Mexico's first civic  hackathon  in 2011, their team won with a tool that shared public data on crime and schools. He recalls meeting U.N. officials and U.S. civic startup stars at that event; soon after, he started doing work for co-hosts Soto and Salazar at Citivox, and attending every civic hackathon he could. \n\n \n\n It wasn't long before Wilhelmy spotted that key flaw of civic-tech solutionism in action: coders at those events often built novelty apps that failed to address real needs. Late last year, he and a few other Mexican startup vets sought a fix, creating an online platform where NGOs or government agencies can describe specific problems for hackers to browse and then team up to solve - framing relevant issues from the start. The platform, named Codeando Mexico, has since hosted more than  30 civic-themed challenges . \n\n \n\n With Soto as an advisor, the team seized on the scandal surrounding the \"millionare's app\" to formally launch in March, calling for help \" taking down the Mexican tech mafia \" - a play on the big, slow software makers that dominate public contracting around the world. In that, Codeando Mexico tackled a central civic-tech target: procurement, widely considered one of the public spheres ripest for reform. Its goal, according to Wilhelmy, was to replace clueless or \"compadrismo\" crony contracting with micro-procurement, swapping traditional suppliers for leaner teams of open-source coders who can release and revise what they build in near real-time. \"It's like the Robin Hood of procurement: You take money that's being spent on big projects and bring it to the developer community, giving them an opportunity to work on stuff that matters,\" he said. \"There's a whole taboo around software: government thinks it has to be expensive. We're sending a message that there are different ways to do this; it shouldn't cost so much.\" \n\n \n\n The maker of the costly congressional app in question, Mexico City consultancy  Pulso Legislativo ,  insisted  last spring that its hefty price tag didn't reflect its software as much as the aggregated data and analysis behind it. But critics were quick to note that Mexican lawmakers already had access to similar data compiled by at least five publicly-funded  research centers  - not to mention from INFOPAL, a congressional stats system with its own  mobile application . With Mexico then in the midst of a contentious  telecom reform , the public may've been especially primed to pounce on any hint of corruption or wasteful IT spending. Codeando Mexico saw an opening. \n\n \n\n So it was that a crew of young coders, almost all under 23-years-old, traipsed into the legislature, a motley mix of suits and skinny jeans, one-by-one pitching a panel of judges that included the head of the congressional Science and Technology Committee. Drawing on public data culled by local transparency groups, their Android and iOS apps - including the winner, \" Diputados \" -- allowed citizens to track and opine on pending bills and to map and contact their representatives -- still a relatively new concept in Mexico's young democracy. \n\n \n\n \"People often think we're lazy, because we haven't had the capacity to be transparent, to reply in real time or according to other characteristics of the apps we saw today; we haven't had the capacity to respond to the citizen,\" committee chair and congressman Ruben Felix Hays said in remarks reflecting on the event. \"It's clear we have to change the paradigm we've been working with in congress.\" \n\n \n\n Maybe with a push from a small new civic innovation team inside the president's office, they will. \n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\tFollow Theresa Bradley on Twitter: \t\t\t\t\t\twww.twitter.com/tbradley\n\n"}, {"full_text_rss": 0, "media_id": 5968, "description": "<a

revolution, we are told everywhere today, produces democracy. It gives \u201cpower to the people\u201d and dethrones authoritarians; it levels the playing field for distribution of information critical to political engagement; it destabilizes hierarchies, decentralizes what had been centralized, democratizes what was the domain of elites. \n\n \n\n Most on the Left would endorse these ends. The widespread availability of tools whose uses are harmonious with leftist goals would, one might think, accompany broad advancement of those goals in some form. Yet the Left today is scattered, nearly toothless in most advanced democracies. If digital communication technology promotes leftist values, why has its spread coincided with such a stark decline in the Left\u2019s political fortunes? \n\n \n\n Part of this disconnect between advancing technology and a retreating left can be explained by the advent of cyberlibertarianism, a view that widespread computerization naturally produces democracy and freedom. \n\n \n\n In the 1990s, UK media theorists\u00a0 Richard Barbrook and Andy Cameron , US journalist\u00a0 Paulina Borsook , and US philosopher of technology\u00a0 Langdon Winner  introduced the term to describe a prominent worldview in Silicon Valley and digital culture generally; a related analysis can be found more recently in Stanford communication scholar\u00a0 Fred Turner \u2019s work. While cyberlibertarianism can be defined as a general digital utopianism, summed up by a simple slogan like \u201ccomputerization will set us free\u201d or \u201ccomputers provide the solution to any and all problems,\u201d these writers note a specific political formation \u2014 one\u00a0 Winner describes  as \u201cecstatic enthusiasm for electronically mediated forms of living with radical, right-wing libertarian ideas about the proper definition of freedom, social life, economics, and politics.\u201d \n\n \n\n There are overt libertarians who are also digital utopians \u2014 figures like Jimmy Wales, Eric Raymond, John Perry Barlow, Kevin Kelly, Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, Julian Assange, Dread Pirate Roberts, and Sergey Brin, and the members of the Technology Liberation Front who\u00a0 explicitly describe themselves  as cyberlibertarians. But the term also describes a wider ideological formation in which people embrace digital utopianism   as  compatible  or even  identical with  leftist politics opposed to neoliberalism. \n\n \n\n In perhaps the most pointed form of cyberlibertarianism, computer expertise is seen as directly applicable to social questions.\u00a0 In  The Cultural Logic of Computation ,   I argue that computational practices are intrinsically hierarchical and shaped by identification with power. To the extent that algorithmic forms of reason and social organization can be said to have an inherent politics, these have long been understood as compatible with political formations on the Right rather than the Left. \n\n \n\n Yet today, \u201chacktivists\u201d and other promoters of the liberatory nature of mass computerization are prominent political voices, despite their overall political commitments remaining quite unclear. They are championed by partisans of both the Right and the Left as if they obviously serve the political ends of each. One need only reflect on the leftist support for a project like Open Source software, founded by libertarian Eric Raymond and corporate sympathizer Tim O\u2019Reilly and widely celebrated by libertarians and corporations, to notice the strange and under-examined convergence of the Right and Left around specifically digital practices whose underlying motivations are often explicitly libertarian. \n\n \n\n When computers are involved, otherwise brilliant leftists who carefully examine the political commitments of most everyone they side with suddenly throw their lot in with libertarians \u2014 even when those libertarians explicitly disavow Left principles in their work. \n\n \n\n This, much more than overt digital libertarianism, should concern the Left, and anyone who does not subscribe to libertarian politics. It is the acceptance by leftists of the largely rhetorical populist politics and explicitly pro-business thought of figures like Clay Shirky (who repeatedly argues that representative democratic and public bodies have no business administering public resources but must defer to \u201cdisruptive\u201d forces like Napster) and Yochai Benkler (whose  Wealth of Networks  is roundly celebrated as heralding an anticapitalist \u201csharing economy,\u201d yet remains firmly rooted in capitalist economics) that should concern us, especially when they are taken up as if they are obviously positions the Left should favor. It is the boastful self-confidence of engineers and hackers that their advanced computer skills inherently qualify them to say a great deal about any part of the social fabric to which we are lucky enough to have them contribute, regardless of their understanding of politics or society. \n\n \n\n The inherent claim informing these politics of digital utopianism is that the political world has shifted so radically due to digital technology that the old rules do not apply; computers represent such a fundamental break in human history that they justify altogether new ethical and political standards. \n\n\n\n \n\n Cyberlibertarianism is on display everywhere today, despite rarely referring to itself by that name. It is evident in the tech industry\u2019s miserable track record regarding gender equality \u2014 where Jessica Roy, a rare female technology journalist,  on giving up her position as a tech blogger writes  of \u201cnarcissism masquerading as enlightened futurism\u201d and of \n\n \n\n \n\n all of the overeager startup hangers-on and fedora-wearing \u2018bitch, make me a sandwich\u2019 tools convinced code will save the world, whose willful blindness just helps perpetuate a sexist, racist, classist environment where white guys with computer science degrees can continue jerking off other white guys with computer science degrees until millions of dollars fall in their laps and they can shout, \u201cMERITOCRACY.\u201d \n\n \n\n \n\n Few of those fedora-wearing \u201ctools\u201d probably see themselves as sexist or racist and fewer still follow Ayn Rand. Yet their practice makes these facts almost irrelevant. The view that \u201ccode will save the world\u201d makes most forms of direct political engagement unnecessary or even unwelcome. These cultural politics are anathema to leftist concerns with social equality, yet such technological \u201c solutionism \u201d is still seen by many on the Left as emblematic of genuinely leftist political thinking \u2014 not the retrograde movement it actually is. \n\n \n\n Philip Mirowski offers a useful analysis of these political formations in   Never Let a Serious Crisis Go to Waste  . Tracing the history of the founding figures of contemporary libertarianism, especially Friedrich Hayek, Ludwig von Mises, Karl Popper and others, Mirowski notes that their writings were less about establishing a clear conceptual position than consolidating and managing political power. Over time, their thought came to function as a set of \u201cshells\u201d or \u201cRussian Dolls\u201d in which participants in outer shells need not, and often must not, understand their connection to members of shells closer to the center. \n\n \n\n Neoliberals in the innermost shell (like the Koch brothers) use libertarians at farther removes (like the Tea Party) not always to realize their agenda directly, but to push political discourse to the hard right. The Tea Party attack on government has less to do with ending government per se than providing a political power base to support the drafting of regulatory programs (like  \u201cfiscal reform\u201d programs  organized at the state level by ALEC) and gutting regulatory enforcement mechanisms (like environmental oversight of energy industries) \u2014 even though most Tea Party members may not embrace much of this agenda. \n\n \n\n Cyberlibertarian discourse functions very much as one of Mirowski\u2019s Russian dolls. It appears to advocate total openness, absolute freedom, radical democracy, and the creation of new social benefits via technological innovation \u2014 as  one advocate puts it  in a suggestively paradoxical formulation, \u201cwe are at an inflection point where we have to use the technology at our disposal to further democratize our democracy and thus increase its very legitimacy.\u201d \n\n \n\n But such rhetoric actually works best at casting existing practices and institutions as \u201cclosed,\u201d not \u201copen\u201d;\u00a0certain forms of thinking as promoting freedom while others do not; and, most importantly, the circulation of corporate capital as the most direct realization of social change. Cyberlibertarianism\u2019s ideological positions are actively destructive to leftist politics by disparaging government in ways similar to Tea Party libertarianism and its regulatory program, offering no resistance to neoliberal incursion into a variety of political spheres, promoting individualism in political power and action, and distracting and defusing resistance to capitalist power. \n\n \n\n It is remarkable how much cyberlibertarian practice conforms to these precepts. The most vocal and potent political activity of cyberlibertarians has been the defeat of certain governmental regulations (such as SOPA and PIPA, opposition to which was  supported and even coordinated by Google ), which have turned out to be less anti-corporate than  in service to some corporate agendas while attacking others  (especially those of \u201ccontent providers\u201d). They argue that intellectual property does not deserve the protections given to \u201creal\u201d property while offering no substantive challenges to the privileges associated with real property \u2014 a view that  J.M. Pederson calls \u201cinformation exceptionalism.\u201d  \n\n \n\n Cyberlibertarians across the political spectrum focus a great deal on the promotion of tools, objects, software, and policies whose chief benefit is their ability to escape regulation and even law enforcement by the state (including surveillance-avoidant technologies and applications such as Tor, end-to-end encryption, PGP and Cryptocat). They routinely portray government as the enemy of democracy rather than as its potential realization. Generally, they refuse to construe corporate power on the same order as governmental power; in close alignment with libertarianism, they implicitly suggest companies like Google and Facebook should be entirely unconstrained by governmental oversight. \n\n \n\n As Mirowski and others have noted, when libertarians talk about \u201cfreedom,\u201d they are using the word in a different sense from the ones we usually presume in general political conversation. They mean either \u201ceconomic freedom\u201d (the freedom for capital to do whatever it wants without oversight or regulation) or the related but slightly more general \u201cnegative freedom\u201d (roughly, freedom from all governmental regulation). The same is true of the signal cyberlibertarianism keywords: terms like \u201cfree\u201d and \u201copen,\u201d and terms drawn from business theory like \u201cinnovation\u201d and \u201cefficiency.\u201d Like \u201cfreedom,\u201d these words in their ordinary usage point at abstract values with which leftists are likely to endorse. And of course, many things that earn these names are worthy projects and causes. \n\n \n\n But the way these words are used in contemporary discussions is highly specialized. \u201cOpen\u201d and \u201cfree\u201d are used as marketing labels that, once attached to one way of looking at a problem, serve to shut down substantive debate: once one side of the debate is labeled \u201copen\u201d or \u201cfree,\u201d both corporatist and leftist thinkers tend to presume that that side must be the hospitable one. \u201cInnovation\u201d and \u201cefficiency,\u201d especially when used outside of directly economic contexts, function in a different way: leftist thinkers  appear to take them  to point vaguely to some form of political vanguardism, while rightist thinkers hear in them assurance that their main goals, the accumulation of wealth and power, can continue unabated. \n\n \n\n Witness the use of these terms with regard to higher education by entrepreneurs and business leaders like  Sebastian Thrun  and  Clayton Christensen : to educators they often sound like calls for  creative, paradigm-shifting work within the academic context , but to venture capitalists and corporations, they point directly at  product sales and access to the revenue streams  associated with higher education. \n\n \n\n That the digital world forces us to restate fundamental definitions while offering no principled justification for doing so is evident in many of the organizations that defend the vague concept of \u201cdigital freedom.\u201d Where the ACLU rests on clearly-stated principles of First Amendment jurisprudence, the Constitutional principles of its apparent digital equivalent, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), remain opaque. \n\n \n\n EFF often takes positions that are pro-corporate or unrelated to leftist principles. Despite this, many left-leaning digital insiders see the EFF as hospitable to their own politics, while the EFF is roundly embraced and even funded and in part staffed by overt digital libertarians. ( EFF was founded  by core cyberlibertarian John Perry Barlow, former Lotus Corp President Mitch Kapor, and John Gilmore, an early employee of Sun Microsystems; out of  the 11 members of its current Board of Directors , 6 are either overt libertarians and/or self-described entrepreneurs or corporate executives.) Similarly, as Community Informatics researcher (and, unusually among digerati, explicit defender of leftist principles) Michael Gurstein notes\u00a0 in a recent piece about the 2012 Internet Governance Forum in Baku , \n\n \n\n \n\n while so loudly advocating for freedom from (whatever\u2026), the  Internet Freedom coalition  [of which EFF is a member] was, in fact, providing the diplomatic cover and lobbying campaign to ensure that no outcome of Internet governance would interfere with the overall US strategy of freedom \u201cto\u201d \u2014 surveil, subvert, suborn and overall embed and maintain (as the NSA so aptly put it) \u2014 \u201ctotal information dominance\u201d of the Internet. \n\n \n\n \n\n In fact, the coalition is one of the many worldwide right-wing political action organizations with similar interests \u2014 in this case,  devoted to opposing  \u201cthree basic threats to Internet Freedom: Taxes, Regulations, and any attempt by the United Nations to manage the Internet.\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n Cyberlibertarianism even surfaces in the projects of \u201ccivic hackers,\u201d the most well-known of which is Code for America (CfA). On the surface the project appears laudable: skilled programmers choose to devote free time to contribute to community and government projects. Yet CfA is an independent nonprofit funded by both corporate and nonprofit dollars . Their \u201ccivics\u201d are incredibly ill-defined: civic hacking projects don\u2019t encourage their participants to reflect on how government functions or what government is supposed to be. \n\n \n\n Instead, private citizens  are revising government outside of democratic structures  \u2014 and often in substantive ways. Rather than \u201ccivics\u201d as the term has historically been understood in the US \u2014 disinterested, public-facing, not-for-profit contributions to the general welfare \u2014 this is actually its opposite: corporate-funded interests tweaking democratic institutions primarily for their own benefit. \n\n \n\n Most who hear the phrase \u201ccivic hacking\u201d would likely be surprised by the significant emphasis CfA places on not merely cooperating with but actively promoting business, generating private profit from governmental resources extracted without charge from citizens. It is no accident that, along with \u201cfree\u201d and \u201copen,\u201d two of the words most frequently encountered in CfA\u2019s promotional materials, are \u201cefficiency\u201d and \u201cinnovation.\u201d CfA directly promotes the development of for-profit corporations that make money off of open government data via its  \u201cIncubator\u201d and \u201cAccelerator\u201d programs  for tech startups. \n\n \n\n In the application of the typical hacker \u201cwe know better\u201d philosophy to democratic government, civic hacking introduces an antidemocratic mechanism into democracy. That mechanism privileges not \u201ccivics,\u201d but the extraction of public resources for use by concentrated capital. \n\n \n\n One index of the subtle shift in politics occasioned by cyberlibertarianism can be found in the work of a central advocate of Open Government and civic hacking,\u00a0 Carl Malamud . Malamud is widely taken to be a figure friendly to the Left, and his staunch advocacy of open information and public governance is easy to understand in terms compatible with Left causes. Yet Malamud himself rarely writes about core principles that make this identification simple or direct, and his work is championed by libertarians. He actively promotes the view that intellectual property is valueless because it is non-scarce \u2014 a view that Mirowski convincingly aligns with economic libertarianism. \n\n \n\n Tom Slee observes in \u201c FutureEverything: Notes Against Openness \u201d that \u201cthe language of transparency, the language of non-commercial civic engagement, and the romantic language of rebellion are being used to provide an exciting and appealing facade for an agenda that has nothing to do with transparency, nothing to do with civic participation, and a lot to do with traditional power politics and profit making.\u201d As Slee notes, CfA and the Open Government movement have done less for the public than for corporations, some of which have been built almost entirely on the availability of public data. \n\n \n\n The most famous of these is\u00a0 Zillow , the real estate listing service that draws large amounts of data from public records. Malamud\u2019s own\u00a0 project to \u201cliberate\u201d SEC Edgar filings  has arguably\u00a0 served corporate interests  \u2014 investors and securities traders have been the primary users of the liberated SEC data \u2014 much more clearly than it has served any comprehensible Left causes. \n\n\n\n \n\n Computers can be useful for the Left, of course. But leftist ends cannot be served without clearly articulating what those goals are and how they are to be achieved \u2014 in most cases  prior to  discussions of the means by which those ends might be achieved. Movements that claim to escape politics never do, and they are far too easily assimilated to the status quo of power and capital than to resisting it. \n\n \n\n We must not mistake the \u201ccomputer revolution\u201d for anything like a political revolution as various leftist traditions have understood it. The only way to achieve the political ends we pursue is to be absolutely clear about what those ends are. Putting the technological means for achieving them ahead of clear consideration of the ends is not merely putting the cart before the horse; it is trusting in a technological determinism that has never been and will never be conducive to the pursuit of true human freedom. \n\n \n\n At bottom, cyberlibertarianism holds that society\u2019s problems can be solved by simply construing them as engineering and software problems. Not only is this false, but in many ways, it can make the problems worse. Since much of the thought grounding it emerges from the Right, encouraging mass computerization as a political project typically encourages the spread of rightist principles, even if they are cloaked in leftist rhetoric. \n\n \n\n When we assume that the goals of the Left are promoted just by digital innovation, we too easily forget to think carefully and deeply about how to articulate those goals, and to work with others who share them. We put faith in a technocratic progressivism that does not clearly emerge from leftist foundations and that, without close and careful work, is unlikely to support those foundations. Most worryingly, we put aside active efforts to solve social problems and advance leftist perspectives by giving in to a  technological form of magical thinking  that is the opposite of engaged political action. \n\n\n\n"}, {"full_text_rss": 0, "media_id": 5933, "description": "(<i>University of South Florida (USF Innovation)</i>) The current special issue of Technology and Innovation- Proceedings of the National Academy of Inventors is devoted to presentations from the Second Annual Conference of the National Academy of Inventors&#174; hosted by the University of South Florida, last February 21-23, 2013.

innovation \n\n \n\n Innovators gathered from around the world to honor academic invention \n\n \t\n\n TAMPA, Fla. (Jan. 9, 2014) \u2013 The current special issue of   Technology and Innovation- Proceedings of the National Academy of Inventors\u00ae   is devoted to presentations from the Second Annual Conference of the National Academy of Inventors\u00ae (NAI) hosted by the University of South Florida, last February 21-23, 2013. \n\n \t\n\n \"This conference attracted 200 inventors and innovators from 60 universities, research institutes, and government agencies worldwide,\" said Nassar Arshadi, vice provost for research, Office of Research Administration, University of Missouri, St. Louis. \"A highlight of the conference was the induction of NAI Charter Fellows, including 101 renowned scientists and innovation pioneers from 56 research institutions who collectively hold over 3,200 patents. The goal of the conference was to address research discovery, innovation, and entrepreneurship.\" \n\n \t\n\n In his keynote address, newly inducted Charter Fellow Robert Langer of MIT, who holds over 800 patents, challenged the audience to \"find a way that works\" to get their inventions to market regardless of skeptics. A pioneer of new technologies, including transdermal delivery systems, Langer told attendees that he often met resistance from critics in the form of \"it can't be done.\"  He is one of only three Americans who have won both the U.S. National Medal of Science and the U.S. National Medal of Technology and Innovation. \n\n \t\n\n Nine papers selected from this year's conference are included in this special issue of  Technology and Innovation . \n\n \t\n\n  Vitamin D\t  \n\n \t\n\n Hector DeLuca, University of Wisconsin-Madison, an inventor with more than 150 patents and the founder of his own biotechnology company, spoke on the development of Vitamin D analogues with therapeutic potential as new applications of Vitamin D-like compounds find their way into health care.  He also discussed commercializing university intellectual property and conflicts that can be avoided in the process. \n\n \t\n\n  Camera-on-a-chip  \n\n \t\n\n The early development of this technology was described by its inventor, Eric Fossum, Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College. Originally designed for the U.S. space program and now commercialized, the technology is used in many products, including cell phone and web cameras, automobile safety systems, and medically for swallowable pills with embedded cameras for use in endoscopy. \n\n \t\n\n  Small, low cost space craft  \n\n \t\n\n The University of North Dakota's program to develop a template for creating a small, low cost spacecraft with the cost of parts under $5,000 was described by Jeremy Straub, Department of Computer Science. The process of designing and constructing the OpenOrbiter is providing valuable educational benefits for students as well as enabling wider future CubeSat applications, said Straub. \n\n \t\n\n  In vivo wireless communication  \n\n \t\n\n Wireless communications and networking can create a paradigm shift for minimally invasive surgeries, said Gabriel Arrobo and Richard Gitlin of the University of South Florida Department of Engineering. The reliable and efficient wireless radio frequency communications of high-definition video are important issues for in vivo communications. The presenters discussed the beneficial potential for Diversity Coding of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing to improve transmission and reliability for the in vivo environments. \n\n \t\n\n Kerri Killen and Samantha Music, Versor, Inc., described their invention, the \"electrogoniometer,\" which, as an alternative to the use of X-rays, measures the range of motion of the human spine. The device was developed especially for those who have had back surgeries and have repeated X-ray evaluation before and after surgery. They developed and patented the non-invasive device in order to reduce patient exposure to radiation that continues despite the most advanced X-ray products.  \n\n \t\n\n Anagha Jamthe, the Center for Distributed and Mobile Computing, University of Cincinnati, and colleagues discussed potential applications of Wireless Sensor Networks and Body Area Sensor Networks, such as providing real-time monitoring of Parkinson's disease patients and also tracking and gaining a better understanding of sports-related concussions and other injuries that develop or worsen over time in athletes. \n\n \t\n\n According to presenter Gregg D. Givens, Department of Communication Sciences, East Carolina University, and his colleagues, providing hearing health care to patients in geographically remote areas with little clinic access could be accomplished through a cloud-based distribution system where the patient and audiologist are connected by an Internet server. While such a system exists, its acceptance has been slow because of an incompatibility of reimbursement and licensure in traditional health care practice, said Givens.  \n\n \t\n\n Babs Carryer, Carnegie-Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh, advocated the use of a commercialization guide for academic inventors that schematically poses a series of questions to help inventors with the details of commercializing their technology and making strategic decisions. Although academic inventors are usually assisted by their technology transfer offices, her recommendations are aimed at providing helpful insights for those who want to be more proactive in the process. \n\n \t\n\n The 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as \"Obamacare,\" has many implications, including those for drug discovery and commercialization. Haskell Adler, senior licensing manager, Moffitt Cancer Center, focused on two aspects: the role played by an Independent Advisory Board and the new rules governing biosimilar products. The first aspect may reduce drug prices while the second aspect may encourage drug development by providing a 12-year exclusivity to a drug, beginning with its FDA approval even if its patent has expired. \n\n \t\n\n The special issue of  Technology and Innovation  also contains two papers that were not presented at the conference. The first paper, by Karen Holbrook, former president of The Ohio State University and Paul Sanberg, senior vice president for Research & Innovation at the University of South Florida, examined the high cost of successful university research, concluding that universities' ambitious research agendas commit them to ever increasing costs. The authors lay out the implications current practices may have on future university research and offer insightful recommendations. \n\n \t\n\n Also in this issue, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) discusses its participation in the National Day of Civic Hacking, a nationwide effort to encourage information sharing between citizens and government agencies and to promote the rapid development of useful applications. Alexander Camarota, from the USPTO's Office of Innovation Development, details the USPTO's participation by sharing a data set of existing registered trademark information with civic hackers with the goal of creating more versatile search tools. The Third Annual Conference of the National Academy of Inventors\u00ae will take place March 6-7, 2014, at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office headquarters in Alexandria, VA.\t \n\n\n\n \t\n\n The  National Academy of Inventors  is a 501(c)(3) non-profit member organization comprised of U.S. and international universities, and governmental and non-profit research institutions, with over 3,000 individual inventor members and Fellows spanning more than 200 institutions, and growing rapidly. It was founded in 2010 to recognize and encourage inventors with patents issued from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, enhance the visibility of academic technology and innovation, encourage the disclosure of intellectual property, educate and mentor innovative students, and translate the inventions of its members to benefit society.

And that \u201csystem\u201d doesn\u2019t have to be a technical one.

He created the first volunteer firefighting brigade, in Philadelphia, because he saw that the city was ill-equipped to tackle its many fires on its own.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Though Franklin may be the greatest American civic hacker he\u2019s certainly not the only one. Here are a few other citizens who saw a system in need of fixing and decided to make it better for everyone\u2019s good:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Alexander Hamilton:</strong> My favorite founding father, Hamilton anticipated the biggest threats to the nascent United States and took it upon himself to make sure they were addressed. He was a main instigator for the Constitutional Convention and famously drafted the Federalist Papers, creating the political will to get the Constitution passed. After that, he set up the financial systems that allowed America to become financially independent from Europe and became our first Treasury Secretary.<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#ffffff;\">.</span></li>\r\n<li><strong>Johnny Appleseed:</strong> The original <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/ron_finley_a_guerilla_gardener_in_south_central_la.html\" target=\"_blank\">guerrilla gardener</a>, John Chapman is a legend for spreading diverse apple species across the American midwest. But his movement was more than about planting trees &#8212; he was also spreading a message of civic responsibility for land and nature, and helped spawn the conservation movement.<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#ffffff;\">.</span></li>\r\n<li><strong>Harriet Tubman:</strong> One of the architects of the Underground Railroad &#8212; possibly the greatest civic hack of all time &#8212; Tubman was committed to ending slavery. Rather than wait for Congress to take up abolition, she and a network of hundreds freed thousands of slaves by hacking the system.<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#ffffff;\">.</span></li>\r\n<li><strong>Dolores Huerta and Cesar Chavez:</strong> The mother and father of the modern labor movement, together they basically invented grassroots, networked organizing. Any good civic hacker knows you can\u2019t get much done without a good organizing strategy. They\u2019re also the inspiration for some of the most empowering grassroots movements of modern times, from gay marriage to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DREAM_Act\" target=\"_blank\">DREAM Act</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Those are just a few of many Americans who saw a way their communities and their country could be better and decided to hack the system to make it better.

Despite the bad connotation the word often has these days \u2014 indicating rogue criminals breaking into computer systems, stealing identities, spying or worse \u2014 hacking is really just any amateur innovation on an existing system. And that \u201csystem\u201d doesn\u2019t have to be a technical one. Civic hacking, then, is when citizens see something in the public realm they think can work better and decide to take it upon themselves to push for change. It\u2019s about creating something bigger than the sum of its parts. (You can read about the supposed origin of the word  here .) \n\n \n\n   Catherine Bracy: Why good hackers make good citizens   In the talk I gave at TEDCity2.0, I called  Benjamin Franklin possibly the greatest American civic hacker of all time  \u2014 not just because he was a prolific inventor, but also because he took his curiosity for innovation into the public realm. He created the first volunteer firefighting brigade, in Philadelphia, because he saw that the city was ill-equipped to tackle its many fires on its own. \n\n \n\n Though Franklin may be the greatest American civic hacker he\u2019s certainly not the only one. Here are a few other citizens who saw a system in need of fixing and decided to make it better for everyone\u2019s good: \n\n\n\n \n\n  Alexander Hamilton:  My favorite founding father, Hamilton anticipated the biggest threats to the nascent United States and took it upon himself to make sure they were addressed. He was a main instigator for the Constitutional Convention and famously drafted the Federalist Papers, creating the political will to get the Constitution passed. After that, he set up the financial systems that allowed America to become financially independent from Europe and became our first Treasury Secretary. \n\n \n\n  Johnny Appleseed:  The original  guerrilla gardener , John Chapman is a legend for spreading diverse apple species across the American midwest. But his movement was more than about planting trees \u2014 he was also spreading a message of civic responsibility for land and nature, and helped spawn the conservation movement. \n\n \n\n  Harriet Tubman:  One of the architects of the Underground Railroad \u2014 possibly the greatest civic hack of all time \u2014 Tubman was committed to ending slavery. Rather than wait for Congress to take up abolition, she and a network of hundreds freed thousands of slaves by hacking the system. \n\n \n\n  Dolores Huerta and Cesar Chavez:  The mother and father of the modern labor movement, together they basically invented grassroots, networked organizing. Any good civic hacker knows you can\u2019t get much done without a good organizing strategy. They\u2019re also the inspiration for some of the most empowering grassroots movements of modern times, from gay marriage to the  DREAM Act . \n\n\n\n \n\n Those are just a few of many Americans who saw a way their communities and their country could be better and decided to hack the system to make it better. At  Code for America , we\u2019re trying to inspire the next generation of civic hackers by adding technology to our toolbelt. We hope you\u2019ll come join us. \n\n\n\n"}, {"full_text_rss": 0, "media_id": 5986, "description": "<p>Linux and open source software have demonstrated that collaborative development is a successful model for rapid innovation in the tech sector.

\t\t\tWednesday, 02 April 2014 09:59\t\t  \t\t\tLibby Clark\t\t \n\n \n\n  Linux and open source software have demonstrated that collaborative development is a successful model for rapid innovation in the tech sector. Now that model is being applied in other industries from health care, to city government, to education. \n\n \n\n In Raleigh, North Carolina the open source way is transforming city government through increased access to government data and lower barriers to citizen participation. It's no coincidence that the city is also home to Red Hat, the first billion-dollar company built on Linux. \n\n \n\n Jason Hibbets, a project manager in corporate marketing at Red Hat and community manager for Opensource.com, has been an integral part of the city's open transformation. In his keynote at  ApacheCon  in Denver next week, Hibbets will define the five principles of an open source city and share his experiences with civic hacking in Raleigh, and a government-focused unconference called CityCamp. \n\n \n\n \u201cWhat's really inspiring to me is that open source started as a software development model and has evolved as a way to positively change our society,\u201d Hibbets says in the Q&A, below. \u201cOpen source is truly changing the world, and it\u2019s doing so by being a great way of doing things even beyond software.\u201d \n\n \n\n Here he discusses the similarities between open source software and open city government; how he got involved in Raleigh's open government movement; and some lessons learned along the way. \n\n \n\n  Linux.com: How do you apply open source philosophy and governance principles outside of technology?   \n\n \n\n Jason Hibbets: I use many of the principles from open source and what has been defined as the open source way, such as transparency, rapid prototyping, and collaboration, in my work with both software and non-software communities. To help others understand how I apply the open source philosophy to everything I do, I share examples from my own experiences and strive to maintain a default to open attitude. \n\n \n\n My day job as community manager and project manager for Opensource.com gives me insight into businesses, groups, and individuals who are applying the open source philosophy beyond technology every day. Their work and their projects include everything from tinkering with open hardware projects and using 3D printers for making prosthetics, to innovating how kids learn with programs like Scratch from MIT and extracting data from PDFs with efforts like DocHive. There are a lot of parallels between the stories that we share on Opensource.com and the work I do outside of that in my local community. The great thing is they build on one another. \n\n \n\n  In open source software projects, code is the great equalizer \u2013 or as Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg so succinctly wrote in a  letter to investors : \u201cCode wins arguments.\u201d Is there an equivalent to code in an open source city?   \n\n \n\n Hibbets: In some ways, cities do operate like a software project, and code is called just that: codes (or laws, rules, and regulations). There are people who write city code, and who propose new code, just as in a software project. Ideally, the principles of a meritocracy \u2013 that the best ideas win, or in this case, that the best code wins \u2013 are supported in the open government movement. Determining what the best idea is, however, involves more time and risk. \n\n \n\n In a software project, new code can be tested and the results are immediate, so you can quickly evaluate which code is superior. When you change city code, however, it may take a long time before you can see the effects, and it\u2019s not as easy to go back and undo harm from bad code. Changes in traffic patterns, building codes, or local environmental regulations can have a huge impact on the citizenry, but it could be months or even years before the full effects are known. Many of the barriers that passionate citizens and government IT shops face are related to changing entrenched cultures that develop to manage or minimize that risk. Transparency and collaboration may be easily achievable for an open source city, but rapid prototyping is more difficult; and that slows down decision-making. That means people can\u2019t just bring their best ideas to the table; they must also become agents of cultural and community change. For us, that usually means not only demonstrating the benefits of open source and open data, but also demonstrating that these changes carry little risk. \n\n \n\n Operating in an open source product and development environment, you come to expect quick decisions and rapid prototyping. Tips for those who want to bring their open source know-how to government: be prepared for a slower pace, understand how your government works including policy making and public process, start forming relationships and partnerships with influencers and talented people who can help the best ideas win. \n\n \n\n  What other parallels exist between an open source project and open government?   \n\n \n\n Hibbets: The first three that come to mind are transparency, collaboration, and participation. These principles are essential to both open source and open government. Many of us are familiar with how this works in open source projects, but not so much in government. \n\n \n\n Transparency is important, because as citizens we should know how our tax dollars are being spent, how our representatives are voting, and what transpires in public meetings. Collaboration is critical to a better government. Our communities, our governments, need ideas from all citizens. On an open source project, collaboration is what makes everything tick because cultivating ideas from many participants is what generates the best results. \n\n \n\n In a democracy it's not us versus them, so participation is essential. And, participation is not limited to voting. The government is \"ours,\u201d of the people, and how it operates and what it does should be a participatory process. \n\n \n\n We\u2019re starting to see government agencies bridge the gap; from holding in-person meetings to online collaboration and participation to gather feedback from more citizens. As we think about the bigger picture though, we need to be keen on open standards. Governments (and citizens) should not be limited to proprietary formats. Open standards create a level playing field and allow for interoperability. Deciding on and implementing open standards should be at the top of the list for government IT departments. \n\n \n\n  What inspired you to take what you've learned about open source communities and collaboration and apply it to your own city government in Raleigh?   \n\n \n\n Hibbets: Open source and my city is a blend of my passions. When I first started discovering the open government movement, I realized I could use my knowledge about open source and open source communities and apply that to my local government. For a number of years I used my open source know-how to promote transparency and participation in my neighborhood watch program and other neighborhood organizations. \n\n \n\n My involvement and work with open source of my local government went to a new level when I got involved with an event called CityCamp. It's an international unconference series that brings open source and technology to local municipalities. Then, I had the privilege to co-chair a group of volunteers, of passionate citizens, to create CityCamp Raleigh. We've evolved this over the years to become  CityCamp North Carolina  \u00a0with more of a state-wide focus. Now in its fourth year, we're looking to inspire change in our state government by encouraging them to use more open source solutions, create open data. \n\n \n\n For more on my journey through this process, from neighborhood watch to CityCamp and more, plus a ton of great tips for how to be more involved in open government, check out my book:  The foundation for an open source city . When I reflect back, CityCamp was the catalyst and spark not only for me, but for Raleigh. \n\n \n\n  What valuable lessons have you learned about open source projects and about city government in doing so?   \n\n \n\n Hibbets: The first lesson I've learned is that having a core group of like-minded people working on the project with you is critical. Just like open source projects, you need a nucleus of dedicated leaders and contributors to be successful. This is no different in the open government world. And to be successful in open government, this core group needs to establish key relationships and partnerships with elected officials, city staff, and other stakeholders. \n\n \n\n The second lesson I'll share is to embrace incremental progress. Earlier, I talked about transparency, collaboration, and participation. On the open government front, open source advocates may need to make compromises in order to move the needle and make some progress. For example, some tools that governments are implementing may not use open source software, but may get more citizens involved or engaged. \n\n \n\n There are several platforms for engaging citizens online that foster participation, allow people to collaborate, and provide transparency around what ideas are winning and what\u2019s being voted on. But many, if not all, are not built on open source software or licensing. Do we scrap the platform because it's not under an open source license? Or, do we choose to make incremental progress so that open source is an alternative in the future? \n\n \n\n In many local governments, officials and leaders are looking for turnkey solutions to reduce the burden on the IT department. There is an opportunity there for start-ups to embrace the open source way and find a business model that works with the public sector. \n\n \n\n  What can the open source software community learn from open government projects? How can it contribute?   \n\n \n\n Hibbets: There are many similarities between these two communities, but one advantage that open government projects have is the ability to access and draw from a highly diverse community with a wide range of skills, talents, and resources. While there are a number of larger open source projects that do this very well, many smaller open source projects struggle with getting more project managers, designers, writers, marketers, and people with other valuable skill sets to participate in their project. I think the reason for this is that government projects have such a strong and direct relation to what the general public needs, on a more basic and daily level. Think transparent access to information and ways for citizens to report non-emergency issues. Whereas open source projects tend to be more focused on technology solutions. \n\n \n\n As far as contributing to open government projects, it's just like any other open source community: identify your passion, find a community that fits that passion, and figure out a way to bring your skills to the community. One community that I'm involved in is  Code for America . They have a variety of different projects and programs for people to get involved in. Because a lot of my skills are around community organizing and storytelling, as opposed to writing code, I help organize my local Code for America Brigade in Raleigh and share our progress through blogging and social media. \n\n \n\n  What else do you plan to cover in your ApacheCon keynote? Who should attend and why?   \n\n \n\n Hibbets: Attendees to my keynote should be anyone who wants to take their open source knowledge and apply it outside of technology. I will share stories from my experience with citizens and the local government of Raleigh, so attendees will gain insight into how they can replicate these ideas and projects in their city or town. The ideas I will share will also be applicable to other disciplines, like healthcare and education. \n\n \n\n What's really inspiring to me is that open source started as a software development model and has evolved as a way to positively change our society. Open source is truly changing the world, and it\u2019s doing so by being a great way of doing things even beyond software.\u00a0 \n\n\n\n \n\n    \n\n\n\n  Libby Clark  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \t\t\tRed

It gives \u201cpower to the people\u201d and dethrones authoritarians; it levels the playing field for distribution of information critical to political engagement; it destabilizes hierarchies, decentralizes what had been centralized, democratizes what was the domain of elites. \n\n \n\n Most on the Left would endorse these ends. The widespread availability of tools whose uses are harmonious with leftist goals would, one might think, accompany broad advancement of those goals in some form. Yet the Left today is scattered, nearly toothless in most advanced democracies. If digital communication technology promotes leftist values, why has its spread coincided with such a stark decline in the Left\u2019s political fortunes? \n\n \n\n Part of this disconnect between advancing technology and a retreating left can be explained by the advent of cyberlibertarianism, a view that widespread computerization naturally produces democracy and freedom. \n\n \n\n In the 1990s, UK media theorists\u00a0 Richard Barbrook and Andy Cameron , US journalist\u00a0 Paulina Borsook , and US philosopher of technology\u00a0 Langdon Winner  introduced the term to describe a prominent worldview in Silicon Valley and digital culture generally; a related analysis can be found more recently in Stanford communication scholar\u00a0 Fred Turner \u2019s work. While cyberlibertarianism can be defined as a general digital utopianism, summed up by a simple slogan like \u201ccomputerization will set us free\u201d or \u201ccomputers provide the solution to any and all problems,\u201d these writers note a specific political formation \u2014 one\u00a0 Winner describes  as \u201cecstatic enthusiasm for electronically mediated forms of living with radical, right-wing libertarian ideas about the proper definition of freedom, social life, economics, and politics.\u201d \n\n \n\n There are overt libertarians who are also digital utopians \u2014 figures like Jimmy Wales, Eric Raymond, John Perry Barlow, Kevin Kelly, Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, Julian Assange, Dread Pirate Roberts, and Sergey Brin, and the members of the Technology Liberation Front who\u00a0 explicitly describe themselves  as cyberlibertarians. But the term also describes a wider ideological formation in which people embrace digital utopianism   as  compatible  or even  identical with  leftist politics opposed to neoliberalism. \n\n \n\n In perhaps the most pointed form of cyberlibertarianism, computer expertise is seen as directly applicable to social questions.\u00a0 In  The Cultural Logic of Computation ,   I argue that computational practices are intrinsically hierarchical and shaped by identification with power. To the extent that algorithmic forms of reason and social organization can be said to have an inherent politics, these have long been understood as compatible with political formations on the Right rather than the Left. \n\n \n\n Yet today, \u201chacktivists\u201d and other promoters of the liberatory nature of mass computerization are prominent political voices, despite their overall political commitments remaining quite unclear. They are championed by partisans of both the Right and the Left as if they obviously serve the political ends of each.\u00a0One need only reflect on the leftist support for a project like\u00a0 Open Source \u00a0software to notice the strange and under-examined convergence of the Right and Left around specifically digital practices whose underlying motivations are often explicitly libertarian. Open Source is a deliberate commercialization of Richard Stallman\u2019s largely noncommercial notion of Free Software \u00a0(see\u00a0 Stallman himself on the distinction ). Open Source is widely celebrated by libertarians and corporations, and was started by libertarian Eric Raymond and programmer Bruce Perens, with support from businessman and corporate sympathizer Tim O\u2019Reilly. Today the term Open Source has\u00a0 wide currency as a political imperative outside the software development community , despite its place on the Right-Left spectrum being at best ambiguous, and at worst explicitly libertarian and pro-corporate. \n\n\n\n \n\n When computers are involved, otherwise brilliant leftists who carefully examine the political commitments of most everyone they side with suddenly throw their lot in with libertarians \u2014 even when those libertarians explicitly disavow Left principles in their work. \n\n \n\n This, much more than overt digital libertarianism, should concern the Left, and anyone who does not subscribe to libertarian politics. It is the acceptance by leftists of the largely rhetorical populist politics and explicitly pro-business thought of figures like Clay Shirky (who repeatedly argues that representative democratic and public bodies have no business administering public resources but must defer to \u201cdisruptive\u201d forces like Napster) and Yochai Benkler (whose  Wealth of Networks  is roundly celebrated as heralding an anticapitalist \u201csharing economy,\u201d yet remains firmly rooted in capitalist economics) that should concern us, especially when they are taken up as if they are obviously positions the Left should favor. It is the boastful self-confidence of engineers and hackers that their advanced computer skills inherently qualify them to say a great deal about any part of the social fabric to which we are lucky enough to have them contribute, regardless of their understanding of politics or society. \n\n \n\n The inherent claim informing these politics of digital utopianism is that the political world has shifted so radically due to digital technology that the old rules do not apply; computers represent such a fundamental break in human history that they justify altogether new ethical and political standards. \n\n\n\n \n\n Cyberlibertarianism is on display everywhere today, despite rarely referring to itself by that name. It is evident in the tech industry\u2019s miserable track record regarding gender equality \u2014 where Jessica Roy, a rare female technology journalist,  on giving up her position as a tech blogger writes  of \u201cnarcissism masquerading as enlightened futurism\u201d and of \n\n \n\n \n\n all of the overeager startup hangers-on and fedora-wearing \u2018bitch, make me a sandwich\u2019 tools convinced code will save the world, whose willful blindness just helps perpetuate a sexist, racist, classist environment where white guys with computer science degrees can continue jerking off other white guys with computer science degrees until millions of dollars fall in their laps and they can shout, \u201cMERITOCRACY.\u201d \n\n \n\n \n\n Few of those fedora-wearing \u201ctools\u201d probably see themselves as sexist or racist and fewer still follow Ayn Rand. Yet their practice makes these facts almost irrelevant. The view that \u201ccode will save the world\u201d makes most forms of direct political engagement unnecessary or even unwelcome. These cultural politics are anathema to leftist concerns with social equality, yet such technological \u201c solutionism \u201d is still seen by many on the Left as emblematic of genuinely leftist political thinking \u2014 not the retrograde movement it actually is. \n\n \n\n Philip Mirowski offers a useful analysis of these political formations in   Never Let a Serious Crisis Go to Waste  . Tracing the history of the founding figures of contemporary libertarianism, especially Friedrich Hayek, Ludwig von Mises, Karl Popper and others, Mirowski notes that their writings were less about establishing a clear conceptual position than consolidating and managing political power. Over time, their thought came to function as a set of \u201cshells\u201d or \u201cRussian Dolls\u201d in which participants in outer shells need not, and often must not, understand their connection to members of shells closer to the center. \n\n \n\n Neoliberals in the innermost shell (like the Koch brothers) use libertarians at farther removes (like the Tea Party) not always to realize their agenda directly, but to push political discourse to the hard right. The Tea Party attack on government has less to do with ending government per se than providing a political power base to support the drafting of regulatory programs (like  \u201cfiscal reform\u201d programs  organized at the state level by ALEC) and gutting regulatory enforcement mechanisms (like environmental oversight of energy industries) \u2014 even though most Tea Party members may not embrace much of this agenda. \n\n \n\n Cyberlibertarian discourse functions very much as one of Mirowski\u2019s Russian dolls. It appears to advocate total openness, absolute freedom, radical democracy, and the creation of new social benefits via technological innovation \u2014 as  one advocate puts it  in a suggestively paradoxical formulation, \u201cwe are at an inflection point where we have to use the technology at our disposal to further democratize our democracy and thus increase its very legitimacy.\u201d \n\n \n\n But such rhetoric actually works best at casting existing practices and institutions as \u201cclosed,\u201d not \u201copen\u201d;\u00a0certain forms of thinking as promoting freedom while others do not; and, most importantly, the circulation of corporate capital as the most direct realization of social change. Cyberlibertarianism\u2019s ideological positions are actively destructive to leftist politics by disparaging government in ways similar to Tea Party libertarianism and its regulatory program, offering no resistance to neoliberal incursion into a variety of political spheres, promoting individualism in political power and action, and distracting and defusing resistance to capitalist power. \n\n \n\n It is remarkable how much cyberlibertarian practice conforms to these precepts. The most vocal and potent political activity of cyberlibertarians has been the defeat of certain governmental regulations (such as SOPA and PIPA, opposition to which was  supported and even coordinated by Google ), which have turned out to be less anti-corporate than  in service to some corporate agendas while attacking others  (especially those of \u201ccontent providers\u201d). They argue that intellectual property does not deserve the protections given to \u201creal\u201d property while offering no substantive challenges to the privileges associated with real property \u2014 a view that  J.M. Pedersen calls \u201cinformation exceptionalism.\u201d  \n\n \n\n Cyberlibertarians across the political spectrum focus a great deal on the promotion of tools, objects, software, and policies whose chief benefit is their ability to escape regulation and even law enforcement by the state (including surveillance-avoidant technologies and applications such as Tor, end-to-end encryption, PGP and Cryptocat). They routinely portray government as the enemy of democracy rather than as its potential realization. Generally, they refuse to construe corporate power on the same order as governmental power; in close alignment with libertarianism, they implicitly suggest companies like Google and Facebook should be entirely unconstrained by governmental oversight. \n\n \n\n As Mirowski and others have noted, when libertarians talk about \u201cfreedom,\u201d they are using the word in a different sense from the ones we usually presume in general political conversation. They mean either \u201ceconomic freedom\u201d (the freedom for capital to do whatever it wants without oversight or regulation) or the related but slightly more general \u201cnegative freedom\u201d (roughly, freedom from all governmental regulation). The same is true of the signal cyberlibertarianism keywords: terms like \u201cfree\u201d and \u201copen,\u201d and terms drawn from business theory like \u201cinnovation\u201d and \u201cefficiency.\u201d Like \u201cfreedom,\u201d these words in their ordinary usage point at abstract values which leftists are likely to endorse. And of course, many things that earn these names are worthy projects and causes. \n\n \n\n But the way these words are used in contemporary discussions is highly specialized. \u201cOpen\u201d and \u201cfree\u201d are used as marketing labels that, once attached to one way of looking at a problem, serve to shut down substantive debate: once one side of the debate is labeled \u201copen\u201d or \u201cfree,\u201d both corporatist and leftist thinkers tend to presume that that side must be the hospitable one. \u201cInnovation\u201d and \u201cefficiency,\u201d especially when used outside of directly economic contexts, function in a different way: leftist thinkers  appear to take them  to point vaguely to some form of political vanguardism, while rightist thinkers hear in them assurance that their main goals, the accumulation of wealth and power, can continue unabated. \n\n \n\n Witness the use of these terms with regard to higher education by entrepreneurs and business leaders like  Sebastian Thrun  and  Clayton Christensen : to educators they often sound like calls for  creative, paradigm-shifting work within the academic context , but to venture capitalists and corporations, they point directly at  product sales and access to the revenue streams  associated with higher education. \n\n \n\n That the digital world forces us to restate fundamental definitions while offering no principled justification for doing so is evident in many of the organizations that defend the vague concept of \u201cdigital freedom.\u201d Where the ACLU rests on clearly-stated principles of First Amendment jurisprudence, the Constitutional principles of its apparent digital equivalent, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), remain opaque. \n\n \n\n EFF often takes positions that are pro-corporate or unrelated to leftist principles. Despite this, many left-leaning digital insiders see the EFF as hospitable to their own politics, while the EFF is roundly embraced and even funded and in part staffed by overt digital libertarians. ( EFF was founded  by core cyberlibertarian John Perry Barlow, former Lotus Corp President Mitch Kapor, and John Gilmore, an early employee of Sun Microsystems; out of  the 11 members of its current Board of Directors , 6 are either overt libertarians and/or self-described entrepreneurs or corporate executives.) In a 2011 case, the  Electronic Privacy Information Center  (EPIC)  described EFF  as one of several \u201corganizations that are currently paid by Google to lobby for or to consult for the company,\u201d a charge  which others have seen , at least at times, as accurate. (EFF \u201creject[s] that characterization of their relationship to Google\u201d and presumably to the tech industry as a whole.) \n\n \n\n The phrase \u201cinternet freedom\u201d sounds like it describes a value leftists should support. Yet as Community Informatics researcher (and\u00a0 social justice and equity activist ) Michael Gurstein\u00a0notes, that \u201cfreedom\u201d is often not much like the kind of freedom typically advocated by leftists.\u00a0 In a recent piece about the 2012 Internet Governance Forum in Baku , Gurstein notes: \n\n \n\n \n\n while so loudly advocating for freedom from (whatever\u2026), the Internet Freedom (IF) coalition was, in fact, providing the diplomatic cover and lobbying campaign to ensure that no outcome of Internet governance would interfere with the overall US strategy of freedom \u201cto\u201d \u2014 surveil, subvert, suborn and overall embed and maintain (as the NSA so aptly put it) \u2014 \u201ctotal information dominance\u201d of the Internet. \n\n \n\n \n\n This absorption of leftist rhetoric by the Right leads, in the most extreme cases, to the existence of political action organizations like the  Internet Freedom Coalition  (not the same informal Baku coalition Gurstein refers to above), whose name may not lead many to anticipate its being a  right-wing membership  organization  devoted to opposing  \u201cthree basic threats to Internet Freedom: Taxes, Regulations, and any attempt by the United Nations to manage the Internet.\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n Cyberlibertarianism even surfaces in the projects of \u201ccivic hackers,\u201d the most well-known of which is Code for America (CfA). On the surface the project appears laudable: skilled programmers choose to devote free time to contribute to community and government projects. Yet CfA is an independent nonprofit funded by both corporate and nonprofit dollars . Their \u201ccivics\u201d are incredibly ill-defined: civic hacking projects don\u2019t encourage their participants to reflect on how government functions or what government is supposed to be. \n\n \n\n Instead, private citizens  are revising government outside of democratic structures  \u2014 and often in substantive ways. Rather than \u201ccivics\u201d as the term has historically been understood in the US \u2014 disinterested, public-facing, not-for-profit contributions to the general welfare \u2014 this is actually its opposite: corporate-funded interests tweaking democratic institutions primarily for their own benefit. \n\n \n\n Most who hear the phrase \u201ccivic hacking\u201d would likely be surprised by the significant emphasis CfA places on not merely cooperating with but actively promoting business, generating private profit from governmental resources extracted without charge from citizens. It is no accident that, along with \u201cfree\u201d and \u201copen,\u201d two of the words most frequently encountered in CfA\u2019s promotional materials, are \u201cefficiency\u201d and \u201cinnovation.\u201d CfA directly promotes the development of for-profit corporations that make money off of open government data via its  \u201cIncubator\u201d and \u201cAccelerator\u201d programs  for tech startups. \n\n \n\n In the application of the typical hacker \u201cwe know better\u201d philosophy to democratic government, civic hacking introduces an antidemocratic mechanism into democracy. That mechanism privileges not \u201ccivics,\u201d but the extraction of public resources for use by concentrated capital. \n\n \n\n One index of the subtle shift in politics occasioned by cyberlibertarianism can be found in the work of a central advocate of Open Government and civic hacking,\u00a0 Carl Malamud . Malamud is widely taken to be a figure friendly to the Left, and his staunch advocacy of open information and public governance is easy to understand in terms compatible with Left causes. Yet Malamud himself rarely writes about core principles that make this identification simple or direct, and his work is championed by libertarians. He actively promotes the view that intellectual property is valueless because it is non-scarce \u2014 a view that Mirowski convincingly aligns with economic libertarianism. \n\n \n\n Tom Slee observes in \u201c FutureEverything: Notes Against Openness \u201d that \u201cthe language of transparency, the language of non-commercial civic engagement, and the romantic language of rebellion are being used to provide an exciting and appealing facade for an agenda that has nothing to do with transparency, nothing to do with civic participation, and a lot to do with traditional power politics and profit making.\u201d As Slee notes, CfA and the Open Government movement have done less for the public than for corporations, some of which have been built almost entirely on the availability of public data. \n\n \n\n The most famous of these is\u00a0 Zillow , the real estate listing service that draws large amounts of data from public records. Malamud\u2019s own\u00a0 project to \u201cliberate\u201d SEC Edgar filings  has arguably\u00a0 served corporate interests  \u2014 investors and securities traders have been the primary users of the liberated SEC data \u2014 much more clearly than it has served any comprehensible Left causes. \n\n\n\n \n\n Computers can be useful for the Left, of course. But leftist ends cannot be served without clearly articulating what those goals are and how they are to be achieved \u2014 in most cases  prior to  discussions of the means by which those ends might be achieved. Movements that claim to escape politics never do, and they are far too easily assimilated to the status quo of power and capital than to resisting it. \n\n \n\n We must not mistake the \u201ccomputer revolution\u201d for anything like a political revolution as various leftist traditions have understood it. The only way to achieve the political ends we pursue is to be absolutely clear about what those ends are. Putting the technological means for achieving them ahead of clear consideration of the ends is not merely putting the cart before the horse; it is trusting in a technological determinism that has never been and will never be conducive to the pursuit of true human freedom. \n\n \n\n At bottom, cyberlibertarianism holds that society\u2019s problems can be solved by simply construing them as engineering and software problems. Not only is this false, but in many ways, it can make the problems worse. Since much of the thought grounding it emerges from the Right, encouraging mass computerization as a political project typically encourages the spread of rightist principles, even if they are cloaked in leftist rhetoric. \n\n \n\n When we assume that the goals of the Left are promoted just by digital innovation, we too easily forget to think carefully and deeply about how to articulate those goals, and to work with others who share them. We put faith in a technocratic progressivism that does not clearly emerge from leftist foundations and that, without close and careful work, is unlikely to support those foundations. Most worryingly, we put aside active efforts to solve social problems and advance leftist perspectives by giving in to a  technological form of magical thinking  that is the opposite of engaged political action. \n\n\n\n     \n\n David Golumbia is an assistant professor of English at Virginia Commonwealth University and author of  The Cultural Logic of Computation . \n\n\n\n \n\n We don't understand libel law. \n\n \n\n Our lawyers don't either. \n\n \n\n We'd like to trade in PBR for champagne. \n\n \n\n We won't send you a tote bag. \n\n \n\n We will send you a holiday card. \n\n \n\n And possibly some baked goods. \n\n \n\n We're an independent leftist magazine. \n\n\n\n \n\n This is an excellent way to launder money. \n\n\n\n                     News and Announcements                  \n\n\n\n                     The Vulgar Empiricist                  \n\n\n\n"}, {"full_text_rss": 0, "media_id": 5704, "description": "<p>May 31 kicks off the second annual National Day of Civic Hacking.

Feedback from the participants helped improve the API, and we\u2019re adding code from their projects to a software development kit (SDK) to help others who want to start using the API too. \n\n \n\n The focus of this year\u2019s National Day of Civic Hacking event? Our Petitions  Write  API, which is currently in  beta testing , and will help even more Americans make their voices heard -- allowing them to use the platform of their choice to reach the White House. \n\n \n\n Participants will focus on building out new ways of signing petitions, shaking loose any bugs, and collaborating on ways to improve the API and We the People in general. \n\n \n\n If you have the skills necessary to work with APIs and especially if you\u2019ve developed on petitions platforms before, we want to hear from you. \n\n\n\n \n\n The deadline for applications is 5:00 pm ET on Friday, May 9. Capacity is limited. Those selected to attend the hackathon in person will be notified by email and invited to join us at the White House on May 29. \n\n\n\n"}]
